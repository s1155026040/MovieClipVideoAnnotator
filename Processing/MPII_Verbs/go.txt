0011_Gandhi_00.23.32.785-00.23.38.525 	and he goes into the building, determined to find the source of ba's aloofness.
0011_Gandhi_00.33.50.585-00.33.52.477 	he starts to go down, and others around him, convinced by the authority of his voice.
0011_Gandhi_00.33.51.586-00.33.54.895 	and the miners begin to go down, some face up, shielding their faces with their hands, some burying their faces in the earth and covering their heads with their hands.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.30.069-00.34.30.691 	they begin to go down again and the sergeant wheels his horse and rides at gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.30.762-00.34.31.829 	with deliberate, almost fatalistic pace, gandhi goes first to his knees and then sprawls down flat, his hands over the top of his head, awaiting the blow of the horse's hoof.
