0001_American_Beauty_00.09.49.185-00.09.52.879 	His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself.
0001_American_Beauty_00.11.02.154-00.11.21.276 	We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she: Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom; And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.
0001_American_Beauty_00.11.40.421-00.11.41.892 	They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today.

0001_American_Beauty_00.11.02.154-00.11.21.276 	We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she: Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom; And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.
0001_American_Beauty_00.11.40.421-00.11.41.892 	They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today.
0001_American_Beauty_00.36.48.994-00.36.49.506 	He sees it coming.
0001_American_Beauty_00.39.01.430-00.39.02.783 	We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us.
0001_American_Beauty_00.39.28.506-00.39.29.107 	Finally, we settle on the small make-up MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her computer.
0001_American_Beauty_00.39.50.638-00.39.53.450 	Through a WINDOW on the side of the Burnham's GARAGE DOOR, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall.
0001_American_Beauty_00.45.55.342-00.45.57.707 	He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change.
0001_American_Beauty_00.46.14.222-00.46.15.252 	Below us we see the two Jims, jogging.
0001_American_Beauty_01.04.32.648-01.04.37.097 	His eyes scan hers, curious to see how she reacts to this.
0001_American_Beauty_01.10.34.288-01.10.35.157 	On the WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him.
0001_American_Beauty_01.13.51.852-01.13.59.724 	Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is.
0001_American_Beauty_01.17.38.655-01.17.44.730 	Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry.
0001_American_Beauty_01.18.23.210-01.18.24.630 	We see his image on the TV as she videotapes.
0001_American_Beauty_01.20.23.246-01.20.25.099 	We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.
0001_American_Beauty_01.23.34.030-01.23.36.060 	We see the BURNHAM'S HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily.
0001_American_Beauty_01.24.33.040-01.24.33.116 	Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts.
0001_American_Beauty_01.25.06.801-01.25.10.369 	We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair.
0001_American_Beauty_01.31.19.495-01.31.20.350 	Through the window over the sink, we can see into the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW.
0001_American_Beauty_01.31.20.350-01.31.22.786 	Our view is blurred by the RAIN, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS.
0001_American_Beauty_01.31.25.728-01.31.26.390 	We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he looks naked.
0001_American_Beauty_01.31.58.809-01.32.00.247 	We see only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.42.522-01.32.44.694 	Jane frowns when she sees him.
0001_American_Beauty_01.38.47.821-01.38.48.336 	Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his sweatpants, performing bench presses.
0001_American_Beauty_01.38.49.025-01.38.52.233 	Through the window, we see the Colonel standing outside, watching.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.02.51.618-00.02.52.537 	and sees his black friend.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.11.40.623-00.11.41.946 	If we could read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.16.05.736-00.16.07.723 	she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.17.11.265-00.17.13.437 	She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.19.33.595-00.19.35.210 	And he turns and sees the naked model.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.44.17.003-00.44.26.193 	Melvin, ever the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.23.14.154-01.23.18.077 	As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor changes.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.47.59.642-01.48.16.363 	Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly but deliberately she lowers the towel.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.09.24.394-02.09.28.707 	Melvin walking and though we can see an improvement it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping on the lines.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.12.58.648-02.13.02.534 	CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot land squarely on a crack in the side walk without his knowledge.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.08.52.319-00.08.53.449 	Then we see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.09.07.491-00.09.09.608 	We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitary chess.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.13.35.414-00.13.38.384 	Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.18.00.658-00.18.07.675 	Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.28.36.198-00.28.39.261 	Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a noncommittal smile on Renault's face.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.29.22.238-00.29.30.889 	He sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices Berger at the bar.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.29.38.930-00.29.43.878 	We see Ilsa's troubled profile.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.33.35.628-00.33.36.457 	As he sees Ilsa he stops short.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.33.43.566-00.33.44.960 	Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.42.53.584-00.42.56.701 	His manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in Casablanca.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.47.56.629-00.47.58.506 	We now see Rick's face and he's very drunk.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.55.20.426-00.55.21.352 	He's pleased to see Rick.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.17.145-00.56.22.468 	Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.04.49.934-01.04.54.607 	Annina sees Rick and goes to his table.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.09.45.632-01.09.47.162 	He looks over and sees Rick.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.18.26.327-01.18.32.065 	She sees Victor walking down the street and closes the blind again.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.21.30.658-01.21.33.636 	He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in her hand.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.07.690-01.26.11.878 	He opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.19.976-01.26.21.012 	Rick sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be injured.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.41.965-01.26.44.388 	Carl enters Rick's apartment and sees Ilsa.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.33.57.045-01.33.59.474 	All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking towards them from the bottom of the stairs.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.38.43.234-01.38.45.463 	They all turn to see the plane readying for take-off.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.04.439-01.40.04.858 	Strasser turns to see the plane taxiing towards the runway.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.14.313-01.40.19.701 	Strasser stops in his tracks, looks at Rick, and sees that he is armed.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.41.17.819-01.41.24.848 	As he pours the water into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy label and quickly DROPS the bottle into a trash basket which he then KICKS over.
0004_Charade_00.05.07.559-00.05.09.217 	A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow- covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows beyond.
0004_Charade_00.09.40.098-00.09.42.641 	We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too- familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin.
0004_Charade_00.34.51.196-00.34.52.257 	She stops as she sees something.
0004_Charade_00.34.57.135-00.35.04.076 	SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.
0004_Charade_00.35.12.169-00.35.13.487 	He sees the metal hand.
0004_Charade_00.36.33.204-00.36.47.961 	He sees a light coming through the window and looks in.
0004_Charade_00.41.06.146-00.41.07.842 	REGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face.
0004_Charade_00.49.18.627-00.49.19.980 	REGGIE, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE.
0004_Charade_00.49.36.532-00.49.36.821 	Now we see that the TOURIST, in turn, is following her.
0004_Charade_00.57.08.714-00.57.14.660 	Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of the level part of the roof.
0004_Charade_01.02.36.704-01.02.40.695 	She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun.
0004_Charade_01.06.41.358-01.06.43.738 	Although she is still not high enough to see anything, by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly.
0004_Charade_01.14.13.204-01.14.15.870 	He holds up his wrist so she can see the watch.
0004_Charade_01.22.19.635-01.22.21.319 	He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down.
0004_Charade_01.28.32.789-01.28.32.963 	Inside the booth, REGGIE and ADAM can be seen heading for the door in a hurry.
0004_Charade_01.33.15.271-01.33.16.081 	Suddenly she sees something.
0004_Charade_01.38.08.591-01.38.13.356 	ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run.
0004_Charade_01.40.59.150-01.41.00.861 	CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's hand reaching up to dial a number.
0004_Charade_01.43.11.450-01.43.13.559 	He turns to look and sees REGGIE.
0004_Charade_01.46.10.306-01.46.12.428 	Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door, turns and fires at her.
0004_Charade_01.46.47.952-01.46.52.873 	As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board and throws on all the switches.
0004_Charade_01.46.54.778-01.46.54.950 	He looks around and sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up.
0005_Chinatown_00.19.09.343-00.19.11.142 	When Gittes looks up he sees the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties.
0005_Chinatown_00.28.08.440-00.28.10.361 	Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn.
0005_Chinatown_00.31.36.890-00.31.39.717 	One of the men turns and sees Gittes.
0005_Chinatown_00.31.46.005-00.31.49.502 	Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at seeing one another.
0005_Chinatown_00.34.21.552-00.34.23.485 	Escobar sees him, ignores him.
0005_Chinatown_00.34.44.785-00.34.45.826 	Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her.
0005_Chinatown_00.42.55.023-00.42.55.765 	Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-tone brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his blood.
0005_Chinatown_00.50.50.921-00.50.51.774 	She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him.
0005_Chinatown_00.51.06.793-00.51.09.700 	He stops as he spots a photo of the man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier.
0005_Chinatown_00.53.56.295-00.53.59.309 	The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.
0005_Chinatown_01.06.58.697-01.07.01.650 	Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something.
0005_Chinatown_01.15.37.749-01.15.38.515 	He sees Evelyn first.
0005_Chinatown_01.18.35.288-01.18.38.269 	Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn.
0005_Chinatown_01.30.50.546-01.30.54.922 	Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living room of the small house.
0005_Chinatown_01.31.39.563-01.31.42.722 	Gittes can see the servant again.
0005_Chinatown_01.32.14.815-01.32.17.214 	Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at her.
0005_Chinatown_01.38.47.480-01.38.51.493 	Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table.
0005_Chinatown_01.39.14.143-01.39.14.737 	When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce.
0005_Chinatown_01.39.30.645-01.39.33.471 	Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag.
0005_Chinatown_01.47.46.762-01.47.50.741 	Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him hurries to the door.
0005_Chinatown_01.48.08.130-01.48.10.757 	He sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room.
0006_Clerks_00.02.11.380-00.02.11.724 	We now see his face.
0006_Clerks_00.03.38.411-00.03.40.704 	Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE approach.
0006_Clerks_00.21.14.660-00.21.16.117 	We've seen this same routine before.
0006_Clerks_00.32.48.970-00.32.51.263 	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was even heard.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.04.33.333-00.04.35.653 	Before we see the lettering he slides it into his pocket.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.06.11.996-00.06.17.325 	He moves forward and OUT and in his place we see two police cars, small in distance, coming fast.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.08.14.241-00.08.16.553 	BEN wakes, sees PREACHER, and hits him so hard in the face that he falls from bunk to floor.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.11.19.953-00.11.23.434 	He looks past her, and we see two small CHILDREN asleep in a big brass bed.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.11.52.910-00.11.53.951 	He approaches his children, across whose bed WE SHOOT without yet seeing them.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.13.24.550-00.13.26.018 	WILLA'S face is seen within; serving a customer, she sees them and waves them away.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.14.51.524-00.14.55.523 	He moves, and as his shadow moves away we see the shadow of PREACHER, motionless.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.14.57.913-00.14.59.206 	JOHN notices her and sees it.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.24.58.496-00.25.02.128 	At start of scene we see only JOHN's feet; he's under the skiff, examining it.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.34.30.568-00.34.39.703 	We see the paper-dolls blow past him.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.44.22.531-00.44.26.053 	Then he leans over to see what's wrong.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.45.16.429-00.45.16.657 	It is on the ground; we don't see their chins.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.51.44.442-00.51.47.645 	JOHN sees PEARL'S expression and takes her hand.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.54.54.703-00.54.57.368 	They struggle through the sumac and pokeberry weeds at edge of river, towards skiff, whose prow, tethered to willow, we see throughout this un-moving shot, at our extreme right.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.13.42.792-01.13.46.755 	Maybe we see -- though JOHN does not -- the thanksgiving in her eyes.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.19.37.786-01.19.39.620 	As we see it, the gun-barrel twitches.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.20.44.843-01.20.46.907 	We see him through window.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.21.01.310-01.21.15.173 	After a moment we see her mouth open; and either to comfort herself or to drown out PREACHER'S voice, she joins in the hymn.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.21.40.905-01.21.41.283 	We see through the window.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.31.29.245-01.31.29.712 	We see he holds a watch.
0008_Fargo_00.24.40.447-00.24.43.394 	He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.
0008_Fargo_00.34.54.914-00.34.57.242 	Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform.
0008_Fargo_01.08.04.532-01.08.18.482 	Through the door to the dining room we see Wade picking up an extension.
0008_Fargo_01.12.26.026-01.12.33.425 	Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a prostrate body.
0008_Fargo_01.25.48.654-01.25.50.655 	Behind him we see the cabin door opening.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.27.46.199-00.27.49.214 	Forrest looks at Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.03.23.238-00.03.24.209 	From the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, business machines, etc.)
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.09.35.779-00.09.36.928 	First we see her feet, with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left ankle.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.09.37.092-00.09.40.512 	CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as she descends, until we see all of her.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.13.28.150-00.13.28.676 	He sees Neff standing inside the door.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.33.43.537-00.33.44.878 	As she looks back she sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.39.49.662-00.39.50.276 	Phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.52.26.539-00.52.27.426 	CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM, a little to one side, so that Phyllis is clearly seen but the man's face is not.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.01.333-00.53.02.419 	A redcap sees them and runs up.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.14.819-00.53.16.633 	The conductor and porter see Neff on his crutches and move to help him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.14.110-00.58.16.546 	Their lips are seen moving but what they say is not heard.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.59.27.506-00.59.28.554 	Charlie sees him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.37.372-01.01.38.008 	He sees Keyes and Neff.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.57.487-01.13.58.298 	Lola sees him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the anteroom without recognizing her she stops him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.16.43.701-01.16.50.130 	She turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.00.986-00.03.02.106 	We see him distantly through the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.08.818-00.03.17.373 	We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.36.572-00.03.38.228 	And now, for an instant we see Gandhi close from his point of view.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.16.841-00.04.17.239 	The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.17.138-00.04.21.925 	We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.21.925-00.04.25.524 	We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.08.785-00.04.15.631 	And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence.
0011_Gandhi_00.05.11.432-00.05.17.538 	We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the Kings way.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.57.492-00.06.58.610 	Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.39.421-00.09.43.517 	We see Mr. Baker, a wealthy white lawyer, whose home this is, poking at the fire, slightly amused at Gandhi's Na vet.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.32.835-00.11.35.119 	We see the English reporter waiting skeptically.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.44.014-00.11.45.248 	We see five or six women in saris standing together.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.58.252-00.13.59.991 	The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.07.559-00.15.14.775 	The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.33.972-00.15.37.908 	The sergeant draws a breath, grasping the club, but he bites his lip as he sees Gandhi lift his head feebly, his shaking hands, stained with his own blood, groping for another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.46.195-00.20.47.231 	Beneath the signature we see the boldly printed identification: Jan Christian Smuts.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.21.189-00.21.21.645 	This is where the magazine Indian Opinion is printed and we see stacks of it lying around.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.58.970-00.23.01.405 	We see two women in saris cleaning the toilett.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.59.877-00.23.01.782 	In the background we see two women cleaning a latrine.
0011_Gandhi_00.26.14.073-00.26.15.186 	Gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view, ending with two plainclothes European policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.08.398-00.32.09.247 	In it we can see two uniformed policemen and a civilian.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.25.357-00.36.26.130 	As Gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large barrels of soup, he sees that Khan is serving from one of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.38.06.045-00.38.09.146 	We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk.
0011_Gandhi_00.40.05.521-00.40.08.969 	Smuts signs the last document, then sees Gandhi's doubt -- and misreads it.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.10.642-00.42.12.416 	A large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see that person.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.04.182-00.43.05.562 	We see a banner: THE CONGRESS PARTY.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.06.763-00.46.08.653 	He meets Prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.21.912-00.46.23.008 	Behind him we see Patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society.
0011_Gandhi_00.51.21.290-00.51.27.074 	We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.15.354-00.54.17.206 	As they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.03.050-00.56.06.485 	And fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see Gandhi -- again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end of the second row on the platform.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.56.160-00.56.57.001 	This is the first time we have seen them.
0011_Gandhi_00.58.55.918-00.59.01.463 	We see one peasant face (Shukla) -- which we will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.36.760-01.03.38.604 	From its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be.
0011_Gandhi_01.06.04.640-01.06.09.062 	We see two young men, one seventeen perhaps, the other older, and a girl, sixteen.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.44.391-01.07.46.391 	It contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but Ba.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.52.113-01.07.53.504 	The batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then.
0011_Gandhi_01.09.19.112-01.09.20.153 	And now we see Gandhi in full shot for the first time.
0011_Gandhi_01.12.13.328-01.12.15.066 	We see the front row from his point of view.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.22.765-01.25.23.984 	We see Muslims and Hindus, many of them Sikhs, old men, little children, women with babes in arms.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.25.458-01.25.27.390 	He clutches a copy (we need not see the title) of Gandhi's journal.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.16.488-01.31.18.141 	We are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.54.987-01.37.55.303 	And we can see its cause.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.56.353-01.37.57.299 	As their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.41.672-01.38.47.924 	In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.44.729-01.41.45.024 	In the chaos of the Third Class we see Maulana Azad coming out of a section of the coach.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.53.276-01.41.59.703 	The minute she turns, she stops on seeing the now startled Kallenbach.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.37.623-01.47.38.154 	And now we see Nehru and Azad in the background too.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.19.736-01.49.25.771 	We see a few people working in the background, and a mass of people camped near the entrance, some sprawled, some sitting, some standing -- all waiting.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.48.724-01.50.58.067 	When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.21.333-01.56.24.069 	The clerk, confused as well as astonished, see the judge standing, facing Gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.39.314-01.58.43.032 	From far above the hills we see a car traveling along the road.
0011_Gandhi_01.59.15.048-01.59.17.098 	We see from Walker's point of view an Indian woman walking along the road, leading a tall camel that carries sacks of produce.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.42.264-02.01.44.624 	He becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and he turns to see Walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder.
0011_Gandhi_02.06.25.984-02.06.28.118 	And suddenly a mass of people, hidden by the embankment, appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river, and the camera lifts slightly with their movement and we see that they are but the forerunners of a long tendril of humanity that stretches across the river, all the way back to the distant outskirts of the city.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.32.618-02.07.36.576 	To one side we see two police cars drawn up, and several policemen (a British officer, a British sergeant, and four Indian constables) lined up near them.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.39.948-02.07.40.828 	Among the newsmen we see Collins.
0011_Gandhi_02.09.11.156-02.09.14.948 	As the procession trails into the village, we see several villagers, knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders, run around the police and join the end of the procession.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.35.329-02.14.37.076 	Above the gate we see the sign DHARASANA SALT WORKS.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.23.840-02.15.24.998 	We see Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.30.763-02.25.35.434 	The camera tracks across the platform and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Ba.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.35.434-02.25.41.016 	And the camera tracks again and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Mirabehn.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.48.434-02.25.55.827 	As the jeep passes the camera we pan with it and see the walls of a palace ahead.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.21.549-02.34.24.017 	And slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.24.017-02.34.26.876 	We cut from the pennant to see the aircraft stopping before a reception area, a carpet rolled out toward its door.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.36.279-02.36.37.178 	He turns to see that Mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as Gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.56.975-02.37.01.932 	We have pulled back and we see a whole gathering of Hindu youths near the entrance to the ashram.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.00.795-02.38.02.112 	We have seen Azad and Pyarelal come out on the porch behind Nehru.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.05.160-02.38.08.008 	As they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.08.008-02.38.09.970 	In the back seat we see two men, one of whom is Prakash (The bearded man at Gandhi's assassination).
0011_Gandhi_02.40.08.925-02.40.12.351 	He measures Gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere, and when he is satisfied with that, he turns slowly to Nehru, Patel and Azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.42.23.519-02.42.25.327 	Inside we can just see Mirabehn, spinning too.
0011_Gandhi_02.44.42.295-02.44.47.168 	Patel and Azad are there and Pyarelal of course, and with them now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the first time we have seen him among Gandhi's intimate group.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.26.131-02.45.32.007 	He has turned and seen Gandhi standing slowly.
0011_Gandhi_02.47.15.950-02.47.17.446 	We see three or four black flags and stains of blood on many of them.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.36.061-02.48.37.931 	They are whispering quietly, but Mirabehn has stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.51.083-02.48.52.464 	He does so with effort, and at last he sees Patel.
0011_Gandhi_02.49.57.105-02.50.04.377 	He glances at Patel, and we see that they recognize that their bland conviction that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply misplaced.
0011_Gandhi_02.53.40.569-02.53.59.700 	We see surly knots of belligerent rowdies, mostly young, but not all, hanging on the fringes as we move over the heads of the mass of listening people to a platform where Nehru speaks.
0011_Gandhi_02.58.13.452-02.58.18.159 	We see the police commissioner, Suhrawardy, two doctors, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and some others.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.49.948-02.59.51.656 	We get a wide-angle shot now and see that Bourke-White is shooting one of her favorite subjects again.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.16.201-03.01.19.398 	We see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.13.24.425-00.13.26.205 	The shape stirs, rolls over, and we see HARRY ZIMM, balding, overweight; a movie producer.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.15.02.796-00.15.07.310 	We can see this is a nice place as Harry crosses the entry hall to a doorway, the FLICKERING LIGHT of the television emitting from inside the room.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.17.49.351-00.17.50.327 	Chili turns aronud and sees her standing in the doorway now, her arms folded across that chest, the Lakers T-shirt coming down just past her crotch.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.18.59.653-00.19.01.401 	He's motioning to her for another, when we see a PLANE taxi past the window in the b.g.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.19.00.924-00.19.06.880 	We see a BIG FIREBALL in the b.g.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.26.39.182-00.26.40.682 	Harry points across the street to the Cafe Med where we see a RED FERRARI convertible parked out the front.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.26.41.682-00.26.46.182 	We see MARTIN WEIR and a WOMAN with jet-black hair sitting at a table.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.28.40.396-00.28.45.551 	Chili looks out the window as we see a long black stretch limo pull up to the curb down on the street.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.32.17.569-00.32.18.569 	Ronnie opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.40.09.628-00.40.09.783 	He rounds a corner, and we see an explosion of light up ahead as we come upon.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.40.14.223-00.40.15.652 	As he starts back, he sees Leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.42.35.372-00.42.41.745 	Chili flips through the script, sees a name.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.45.14.909-00.45.22.267 	The guy gives Chili a look, puts his arm around his DATE, and quickly starts up the aisle so that Chili can now see Karen sitting there at the end of the row.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.56.01.780-00.56.04.280 	Harry looks up to see Bo Catlett, dressed up as usual, standing there with the Bear, wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.59.26.822-00.59.29.822 	Chili checks out the bar, sees they aren't there, then looks up at the railing.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.59.36.822-00.59.44.322 	Chili moves to the staircase, now sees the Bear in his Hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.10.15.054-01.10.23.679 	As Ray Bones then walks off, we see coming out a different gate.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.15.12.495-01.15.15.893 	We can now see that one of the Latinos is older, the other two, younger, are his bodyguards.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.18.03.175-01.18.09.580 	Harry, a crumpled heap, looks up and we see his bloody pummeled face as Ray Bones quickly crosses the room.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.18.21.381-01.18.22.238 	Harry actually looks glad to see him.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.18.47.054-01.18.49.289 	Ronnie opens his jacket so that Ray Bones can see the .357 Ronnie's got tucked into his belt.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.32.46.106-01.32.48.933 	Chili opens Leo's bag so that Bo can see the money.
0013_Halloween_00.05.38.634-00.05.43.773 	Then suddenly the POV is covered by the mask and we see through the eye-holes.
0013_Halloween_00.06.05.274-00.06.09.130 	There is a RAPID BLUR as the POV drives the butcher knife into the sister's chest and out again almost before we've seen it.
0013_Halloween_00.10.07.336-00.10.12.206 	Through the windshield we see Loomis rush over to the patient, stand and talk for a moment, then hurry back.
0013_Halloween_00.13.58.683-00.13.59.448 	Through a frost window, we see Laurie bending over the welcome mat.
0013_Halloween_00.14.19.307-00.14.24.103 	We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance.
0013_Halloween_00.15.56.940-00.15.58.684 	From the window she can see the street, and a station wagon parked along the sidewalk.
0013_Halloween_00.18.56.416-00.18.57.935 	We see a car parked in front of a small, closed-down gas station/diner by the side of the highway.
0013_Halloween_00.22.01.392-00.22.02.609 	Out the window we see the three girls on the sidewalk.
0013_Halloween_00.31.29.143-00.31.35.090 	Behind them, through the rear-view mirror, we see LOOMIS' STATION WAGON pull out of an alley and follow along.
0013_Halloween_00.35.00.755-00.35.06.443 	Through the blowing trees we see the full moon rising in the night sky.
0013_Halloween_00.35.13.083-00.35.23.311 	Through the windshield we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye and walk up to the Doyle house.
0013_Halloween_00.35.44.765-00.35.47.537 	The shape gets out of the station wagon, close to CAMERA so we can't see him.
0013_Halloween_00.35.57.030-00.36.03.933 	We see Annie come out of the garage and walk to another two- story frame house: the Wallaces'.
0013_Halloween_00.36.12.927-00.36.14.653 	Through the front room windows we can see Annie talking to the WALLACES as they put on their coats.
0013_Halloween_00.36.48.256-00.36.48.897 	Inside, we see Annie turn on the TV.
0013_Halloween_00.36.51.522-00.36.55.531 	Looking down the side of the house we see Loomis and Brackett walk up to the front porch.
0013_Halloween_00.42.16.127-00.42.21.543 	We see the man as he passes under a streetlight on his way.
0013_Halloween_00.42.58.203-00.42.59.556 	The shape moves to see inside a window of the Wallaces house.
0013_Halloween_00.44.11.708-00.44.13.341 	We see the shape's legs a few feet from the house.
0013_Halloween_00.46.11.498-00.46.12.253 	In the light from the main house, Annie sees the light switch.
0013_Halloween_00.46.28.635-00.46.30.640 	Behind the door we see the outline of the SHAPE STANDING THERE.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.50.373-00.08.54.047 	Then, so that he won't see her moist eyes, she turns and hurries into the entrance hall.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.12.01.548-00.12.11.182 	She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- --and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her-- --and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- --and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- --and the Eel slithers closer, closer-- --and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- --and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.13.23.754-00.13.27.740 	The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be flying.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.42.707-00.29.44.999 	The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, slows.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.45.38.619-00.45.40.656 	She's still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it.

0033_Amadeus_01.02.12.486-01.02.13.086 	We see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce.
