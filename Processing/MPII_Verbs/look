0001_American_Beauty_00.00.56.224-00.01.03.394 	Jane looks at us and sits up.
0001_American_Beauty_00.01.37.227-00.01.38.586 	We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD: LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing PAJAMAS.
0001_American_Beauty_00.01.43.985-00.01.48.384 	He rolls over, looks up at us and sighs.
0001_American_Beauty_00.04.01.342-00.04.02.858 	Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.
0001_American_Beauty_00.05.13.069-00.05.18.464 	Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.
0001_American_Beauty_00.07.27.728-00.07.29.311 	Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.
0001_American_Beauty_00.08.17.773-00.08.18.969 	Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically.
0001_American_Beauty_00.08.50.989-00.08.57.329 	He's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any.
0001_American_Beauty_00.09.14.020-00.09.23.758 	We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying, but it's obvious it's not going well.
0001_American_Beauty_00.10.03.979-00.10.06.234 	We're looking out through the kitchen window at the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer there.
0001_American_Beauty_00.10.07.367-00.10.08.408 	His head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched.
0001_American_Beauty_00.16.08.033-00.16.09.165 	Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles.
0001_American_Beauty_00.16.38.730-00.16.41.567 	Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester.
0001_American_Beauty_00.00.56.224-00.01.03.394 	Jane looks at us and sits up.

0001_American_Beauty_00.19.11.324-00.19.12.563 	We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed.
0001_American_Beauty_00.19.16.093-00.19.17.763 	Even in sleep, Carolyn looks determined.
0001_American_Beauty_00.19.52.435-00.20.00.956 	She looks down at us with a smile that is all things.
0001_American_Beauty_00.21.35.720-00.21.37.302 	We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where the moving van was parked earlier.
0001_American_Beauty_00.21.43.604-00.21.45.152 	He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and starts to videotape her.
0001_American_Beauty_00.23.26.203-00.23.28.159 	We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in.
0001_American_Beauty_00.24.28.434-00.24.32.950 	The Colonel and Barbara look at each other, alarmed.
0001_American_Beauty_00.25.10.572-00.25.11.250 	The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel.
0001_American_Beauty_00.25.26.734-00.25.27.618 	The Colonel looks at them, confused.
0001_American_Beauty_00.25.51.658-00.25.53.177 	The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply.
0001_American_Beauty_00.26.03.087-00.26.05.212 	Ricky sighs, then looks at his father.
0001_American_Beauty_00.28.36.165-00.28.38.019 	He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers.
0001_American_Beauty_00.28.39.450-00.28.41.494 	Jane is unnerved and has to look away.
0001_American_Beauty_00.32.23.830-00.32.26.527 	Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp.
0001_American_Beauty_00.33.33.808-00.33.45.754 	They look at each other for a beat, then look away.
0001_American_Beauty_00.34.20.726-00.34.24.563 	Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.
0001_American_Beauty_00.37.15.172-00.37.16.633 	He breaks the kiss, looking at her in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips.
0001_American_Beauty_00.38.27.202-00.38.32.373 	Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode.
0001_American_Beauty_00.38.56.009-00.38.57.837 	Angela crosses to the window and looks out.
0001_American_Beauty_00.39.01.430-00.39.02.783 	We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us.
0001_American_Beauty_00.39.22.092-00.39.23.525 	We're across from Jane's window, looking in.
0001_American_Beauty_00.43.09.903-00.43.17.966 	Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.
0001_American_Beauty_00.43.44.467-00.43.46.236 	She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively.
0001_American_Beauty_00.50.43.397-00.50.44.315 	Lester looks up, squinting at: The door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a REMOTE at us.
0001_American_Beauty_00.54.46.143-00.54.49.741 	Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh.
0001_American_Beauty_00.57.23.434-00.57.23.619 	He looks over Lester's application, baffled.
0001_American_Beauty_01.01.36.720-01.01.41.548 	He puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door, then notices Jane looking at him oddly.
0001_American_Beauty_01.09.06.338-01.09.25.557 	Jane looks in a mirror and rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out.
0001_American_Beauty_01.09.26.037-01.09.27.190 	We're across from Ricky's room, looking in.
0001_American_Beauty_01.10.34.288-01.10.35.157 	On the WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him.
0001_American_Beauty_01.10.45.760-01.10.46.781 	She stands there with her breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly vulnerable.
0001_American_Beauty_01.13.15.022-01.13.25.107 	He looks at his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face.
0001_American_Beauty_01.20.25.634-01.20.29.278 	Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.
0001_American_Beauty_01.21.41.861-01.21.46.030 	Jane looks at him and sits up.
0001_American_Beauty_01.22.47.854-01.22.48.952 	He lowers the camera and looks at her intently.
0001_American_Beauty_01.24.33.040-01.24.33.116 	Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts.
0001_American_Beauty_01.25.11.695-01.25.12.027 	A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness.
0001_American_Beauty_01.25.12.027-01.25.15.897 	Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self- conscious.
0001_American_Beauty_01.25.42.701-01.25.43.277 	CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.
0001_American_Beauty_01.26.11.024-01.26.12.387 	He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on: The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf.
0001_American_Beauty_01.27.07.007-01.27.08.030 	Lester looks up suddenly when he HEARS.
0001_American_Beauty_01.28.42.131-01.28.43.059 	Buddy looks at her unhappily.
0001_American_Beauty_01.28.59.656-01.29.10.952 	He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and shuts the door.
0001_American_Beauty_01.29.49.438-01.29.56.879 	He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in the window: His arms are pumped.
0001_American_Beauty_01.31.25.728-01.31.26.390 	We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he looks naked.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.10.309-01.32.11.369 	From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving Lester a blow job.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.19.853-01.32.20.642 	Ricky stands, looking a little panicked.
0001_American_Beauty_01.33.06.884-01.33.12.269 	She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.
0001_American_Beauty_01.33.12.928-01.33.13.782 	He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.
0001_American_Beauty_01.35.32.306-01.35.36.385 	She's obviously heard his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes, searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.
0001_American_Beauty_01.36.29.167-01.36.30.951 	The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom window, and then he pulls the drapes shut.
0001_American_Beauty_01.39.37.593-01.39.40.441 	The Colonel just stands there, looking at Lester.
0001_American_Beauty_01.47.23.075-01.47.26.519 	Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then.
0001_American_Beauty_01.47.45.704-01.47.52.236 	Lester looks down at her, his grin fading.
0001_American_Beauty_01.48.51.401-01.49.01.855 	She turns her head to look out the window: The RED DOOR of the Burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain.
0001_American_Beauty_01.52.42.415-01.52.45.310 	Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile.
0001_American_Beauty_01.53.18.010-01.53.27.529 	Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly at: A DOT OF LIGHT falls across an unbelievably starry sky.
0001_American_Beauty_01.53.32.100-01.53.35.875 	They look at each other, alarmed.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.06.34.707-00.06.35.273 	He looks demonic.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.15.36.402-00.15.41.176 	The Young Man stops and looks at her.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.17.08.525-00.17.11.265 	 then he stops and looks at his hand.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.17.11.265-00.17.13.437 	She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.29.664-00.21.30.306 	Melvin just looks at her.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.24.07.800-00.24.10.248 	where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses to look past the terrace to the studio.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.29.48.812-00.29.50.628 	Verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.32.25.349-00.32.32.470 	He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.32.50.607-00.32.52.476 	Carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.36.57.805-00.37.03.653 	As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's surprise.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.37.25.302-00.37.27.525 	Verdell looks up at him.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.38.12.229-00.38.34.938 	anguished, until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.38.41.342-00.38.46.187 	Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a wheelchair and shudders.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.42.03.813-00.42.05.307 	They look stricken.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.42.16.295-00.42.19.535 	Cheryl looks at his utensils.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.43.44.184-00.43.55.803 	Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless situation and rises.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.44.17.003-00.44.26.193 	Melvin, ever the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.49.34.868-00.49.37.946 	Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.49.58.549-00.50.01.170 	As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.54.52.413-00.54.55.627 	Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.00.39.167-01.00.41.039 	Verdell looks at Simon with concern.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.01.27.813-01.01.29.880 	Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's rapt.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.02.25.740-01.02.28.733 	looking apologetically at Simon in stoic ruin.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.03.07.481-01.03.09.859 	She looks as if she's on her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the subject.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.04.18.370-01.04.22.753 	As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her breasts and gasps.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.10.28.848-01.10.34.012 	wide-eyed with apprehension, she looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission for Carol to let it go.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.14.26.918-01.14.34.504 	Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing message.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.18.56.676-01.18.59.968 	She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.20.34.564-01.20.37.850 	Now she looks in another drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries of the ages.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.29.09.285-01.29.12.937 	She looks out her window -- then kisses her fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.40.36.279-01.40.46.164 	Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- then.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.42.09.366-01.42.10.728 	Their faces are close -- she looks at him.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.46.55.952-01.46.58.205 	and now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.50.31.734-01.50.33.062 	Carol looks at Melvin.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.57.15.240-01.57.18.790 	Simon looking at Melvin with some sympathy.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.04.49.447-02.04.51.171 	As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great uncertainty.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.05.12.948-02.05.18.010 	She walks to her wide open window and looks over.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.07.29.141-02.07.33.250 	She looks at him then.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.09.36.076-02.09.37.768 	Melvin looks at her, Embarrassed, self-conscious, His habits making him appear unworthy.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.13.19.045-02.13.20.054 	 Look at each other without a notion of where to take it from here,
0003_CASABLANCA_00.09.37.839-00.09.48.365 	Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his hand, and tears it up.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.09.58.774-00.10.01.484 	If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.12.35.275-00.12.37.570 	Rick looks at Ugarte steadily.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.14.44.817-00.14.48.001 	Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.15.00.989-00.15.03.079 	Rick looks the check over and tears it up.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.15.14.255-00.15.16.477 	Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.15.27.220-00.15.28.959 	She looks at him bitterly, without saying a word.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.15.51.447-00.15.53.700 	Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from the airport.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.16.22.118-00.16.25.113 	Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane taking off from the adjacent airfield.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.16.32.493-00.16.34.372 	Rick still looks in the direction of the airport.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.21.57.526-00.22.01.213 	Ugarte looks around.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.24.19.300-00.24.21.211 	Strasser looks up from the book.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.24.26.974-00.24.27.865 	Rick looks up from the book.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.25.27.891-00.25.33.049 	As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the piano, and the woman looks at Sam.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.25.53.776-00.25.54.976 	Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.28.36.198-00.28.39.261 	Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a noncommittal smile on Renault's face.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.29.19.761-00.29.22.238 	Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.29.59.554-00.30.01.875 	Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.31.47.368-00.31.52.481 	Sam looks very uncomfortable.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.33.32.359-00.33.32.953 	For a long moment he just looks at her.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.35.01.291-00.35.06.020 	Rick and Ilsa look at each other.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.43.07.841-00.43.08.197 	Sam looks at his glass.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.43.26.602-00.43.36.063 	Rick and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.44.14.902-00.44.16.031 	Ilsa looks at him tenderly.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.44.50.803-00.44.54.859 	Ilsa looks at Rick.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.22.394-00.46.30.496 	He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.47.43.807-00.47.49.694 	From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine clouds over him.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.51.18.647-00.51.21.372 	Strasser looks at him.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.17.145-00.56.22.468 	Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.29.929-00.56.30.849 	He looks through the open window in the direction of the linen bazaar.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.41.250-00.56.43.831 	As he exits, Laszlo looks after him with a puzzled expression.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.50.035-00.56.51.133 	She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.00.41.467-01.00.43.078 	Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa.

0003_CASABLANCA_01.08.30.232-01.08.32.110 	Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.09.45.632-01.09.47.162 	He looks over and sees Rick.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.12.00.875-01.12.02.992 	Laszlo looks at him, puzzled.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.13.21.429-01.13.32.712 	Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who sings with passion.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.14.59.052-01.15.06.420 	She looks at him, understanding what he means.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.17.31.685-01.17.33.925 	Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.18.18.870-01.18.23.784 	She stands there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the window.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.18.56.298-01.18.58.419 	Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.18.58.419-01.18.59.566 	He looks up at Rick.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.21.525-01.26.23.692 	Both Carl and Laszlo look up.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.31.573-01.26.33.770 	Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.44.961-01.26.46.210 	He looks at Rick and says nothing.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.28.04.507-01.28.10.435 	He looks away for a moment.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.28.49.294-01.28.51.059 	Laszlo looks for a moment at Rick, then in dignified silence crosses to the officer.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.31.03.407-01.31.07.188 	Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.32.43.309-01.32.45.759 	Renault looks around the empty cafe.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.33.23.764-01.33.29.617 	Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.38.50.330-01.38.52.341 	Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank expression.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.11.819-01.40.13.747 	Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards the telephone just inside the hangar door.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.14.313-01.40.19.701 	Strasser stops in his tracks, looks at Rick, and sees that he is armed.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.43.504-01.40.44.806 	Renault pauses and looks at Rick.
0004_Charade_00.08.04.463-00.08.04.855 	REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised.
0004_Charade_00.09.55.595-00.09.57.116 	She closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again.
0004_Charade_00.17.01.155-00.17.02.990 	He stops, looks down at LAMPERT's body for a moment.
0004_Charade_00.17.18.647-00.17.20.473 	He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit.
0004_Charade_00.17.40.834-00.17.42.427 	He turns to look at the others present.
0004_Charade_00.19.59.142-00.20.03.725 	REGGIE enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar.
0004_Charade_00.20.04.586-00.20.06.285 	BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in.
0004_Charade_00.20.48.103-00.20.55.617 	He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie.
0004_Charade_00.34.57.135-00.35.04.076 	SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.
0004_Charade_00.35.28.672-00.35.39.001 	When she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room.
0004_Charade_00.36.00.562-00.36.04.924 	PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks out.
0004_Charade_00.36.12.910-00.36.13.892 	PETER appears and looks down over the railing.
0004_Charade_00.36.15.854-00.36.18.086 	He now looks around.
0004_Charade_00.36.33.204-00.36.47.961 	He sees a light coming through the window and looks in.
0004_Charade_00.37.13.583-00.37.17.933 	PETER looks in.
0004_Charade_00.45.10.582-00.45.12.807 	BARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway.
0004_Charade_00.45.13.511-00.45.15.480 	As REGGIE looks at the hanging beef.
0004_Charade_00.46.16.649-00.46.18.830 	BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip.
0004_Charade_00.49.17.579-00.49.18.354 	He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work.
0004_Charade_00.49.18.627-00.49.19.980 	REGGIE, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE.
0004_Charade_00.49.20.677-00.49.21.683 	The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, looks up from his coffee, surprised.
0004_Charade_00.49.27.729-00.49.29.654 	REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.
0004_Charade_00.52.10.094-00.52.10.554 	As REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the others.
0004_Charade_00.52.10.693-00.52.11.304 	They are all occupied except one and she looks inside it.
0004_Charade_00.52.12.410-00.52.18.557 	As she looks at it, confused.
0004_Charade_00.52.48.252-00.52.50.544 	SCOBIE looks around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall.
0004_Charade_00.54.26.985-00.54.27.324 	DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street.
0004_Charade_00.55.38.604-00.55.39.776 	Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and leap for it, both landing short of the mark.
0004_Charade_01.04.08.253-01.04.08.881 	A pause as the THREE MEN look at one another.
0004_Charade_01.04.09.024-01.04.09.740 	The THREE MEN look at one another unhappily.
0004_Charade_01.04.47.670-01.04.48.557 	He looks up, then joins GIDEON.
0004_Charade_01.06.24.941-01.06.29.785 	REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top of the high armoire.
0004_Charade_01.07.30.562-01.07.36.383 	The MEN avoid looking at one another.
0004_Charade_01.07.51.680-01.07.57.392 	DYLE, TEX and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking around.
0004_Charade_01.07.58.507-01.07.59.491 	The room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no sign of SCOBIE.
0004_Charade_01.10.00.733-01.10.01.084 	During the pause, he looks into each face in turn.
0004_Charade_01.13.04.508-01.13.13.614 	DYLE looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his shoes.
0004_Charade_01.14.36.648-01.15.02.124 	CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her.
0004_Charade_01.19.00.894-01.19.10.608 	She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate away.
0004_Charade_01.20.02.280-01.20.07.747 	She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction is to look at her.
0004_Charade_01.22.02.503-01.22.03.050 	Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused.
0004_Charade_01.22.19.635-01.22.21.319 	He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down.
0004_Charade_01.23.55.919-01.23.58.306 	ADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks behind him.
0004_Charade_01.25.35.015-01.25.39.167 	He hands her the glasses and she looks through them.
0004_Charade_01.28.33.093-01.28.33.240 	As the DELEGATES look at one another, confused.
0004_Charade_01.30.24.075-01.30.25.909 	As he wheels to look at another booth.
0004_Charade_01.30.27.797-01.30.29.922 	He turns crazily to look at another booth, then another.
0004_Charade_01.33.26.673-01.33.26.833 	JEAN-LOUIS stands looking at some stamps.
0004_Charade_01.33.45.116-01.33.49.176 	JEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember.
0004_Charade_01.37.34.852-01.37.38.847 	She hangs up, looks briefly at TEX's body, shudders, then hurries to the door.
0004_Charade_01.38.08.591-01.38.13.356 	ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run.
0004_Charade_01.38.22.859-01.38.23.376 	REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps.
0004_Charade_01.38.59.854-01.39.01.371 	Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.
0004_Charade_01.40.43.679-01.40.43.948 	ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes.
0004_Charade_01.40.44.085-01.40.44.237 	Moving quickly, he returns to the exit door and looks at the platform.
0004_Charade_01.40.54.871-01.40.56.986 	He looks around in all directions, looking for some sign of REGGIE.
0004_Charade_01.42.18.399-01.42.18.712 	She goes to the corner and looks around it.
0004_Charade_01.42.27.148-01.42.27.296 	She looks back once more at ADAM, then makes up her mind and starts running towards the exit.
0004_Charade_01.43.11.450-01.43.13.559 	He turns to look and sees REGGIE.
0004_Charade_01.44.11.204-01.44.11.949 	REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.
0004_Charade_01.45.23.140-01.45.26.645 	During the following, he looks around, looking for some way out.
0004_Charade_01.46.15.633-01.46.21.337 	CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes off after REGGIE.
0004_Charade_01.46.25.334-01.46.26.205 	As CARSON enters the auditorium and looks around.
0004_Charade_01.46.44.692-01.46.45.183 	He creeps along next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic pieces which fill the room.
0004_Charade_01.46.45.435-01.46.47.043 	As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for REGGIE.
0004_Charade_01.46.53.984-01.46.54.626 	ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage over his head -- and hearing them now.
0004_Charade_01.46.54.778-01.46.54.950 	He looks around and sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up.
0004_Charade_01.47.01.605-01.47.07.041 	CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery, hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.
0004_Charade_01.48.52.393-01.48.54.061 	He looks at the lever marked D-4.
0004_Charade_01.51.31.045-01.51.31.929 	She looks up as REGGIE enters.
0004_Charade_01.51.49.258-01.51.59.552 	REGGIE stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around, confused.
0005_Chinatown_00.07.47.789-00.07.50.948 	Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray.
0005_Chinatown_00.08.37.357-00.08.44.012 	There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.
0005_Chinatown_00.09.23.841-00.09.35.702 	He spreads them on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking downstream from time to time.
0005_Chinatown_00.10.12.150-00.10.13.052 	Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent.
0005_Chinatown_00.13.28.405-00.13.32.233 	He looks at them.
0005_Chinatown_00.16.17.266-00.16.19.448 	He rises, looks up to the roof.
0005_Chinatown_00.16.19.691-00.16.20.681 	He looks to the girl.
0005_Chinatown_00.19.09.343-00.19.11.142 	When Gittes looks up he sees the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties.
0005_Chinatown_00.21.29.818-00.21.32.773 	He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook.
0005_Chinatown_00.26.04.616-00.26.05.183 	Gittes looks behind him.
0005_Chinatown_00.27.54.411-00.28.02.707 	He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object.
0005_Chinatown_00.28.07.113-00.28.07.540 	She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office.
0005_Chinatown_00.29.04.832-00.29.05.841 	Evelyn looks up.
0005_Chinatown_00.33.59.454-00.34.01.197 	Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.
0005_Chinatown_00.34.18.637-00.34.23.363 	At this question, he rises and looks through the doorway.
0005_Chinatown_00.34.44.785-00.34.45.826 	Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her.
0005_Chinatown_00.34.46.035-00.34.48.020 	They look at one another for a long moment.
0005_Chinatown_00.34.47.333-00.34.48.877 	She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes.
0005_Chinatown_00.41.57.361-00.42.00.342 	He fishes for his car keys, looks down.
0005_Chinatown_00.43.49.943-00.43.51.412 	Gittes looks irritated.
0005_Chinatown_00.45.08.312-00.45.10.005 	Gittes looks to his two men.
0005_Chinatown_00.45.57.067-00.45.57.794 	Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose.
0005_Chinatown_00.46.01.017-00.46.02.009 	Evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves.
0005_Chinatown_00.46.02.009-00.46.03.637 	When she looks back up she stares expectantly at Gittes.
0005_Chinatown_00.47.18.844-00.47.21.233 	Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.
0005_Chinatown_00.48.06.192-00.48.08.883 	Evelyn looks squarely at him.
0005_Chinatown_00.50.36.075-00.50.39.463 	He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn looking after him.
0005_Chinatown_00.50.50.165-00.50.50.921 	She looks up.
0005_Chinatown_00.52.07.334-00.52.27.929 	He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more photographs.
0005_Chinatown_00.53.52.149-00.53.55.160 	Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.
0005_Chinatown_00.57.06.845-00.57.07.971 	She looks up when he enters.
0005_Chinatown_01.06.12.873-01.06.15.896 	Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise.
0005_Chinatown_01.06.19.562-01.06.21.733 	Cross looks hatefully at Gittes.
0005_Chinatown_01.07.59.950-01.08.01.208 	Gittes looks a little surprised.
0005_Chinatown_01.08.47.449-01.08.52.390 	Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description.
0005_Chinatown_01.11.32.692-01.11.34.448 	Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer.
0005_Chinatown_01.13.09.770-01.13.12.042 	He looks out.
0005_Chinatown_01.18.03.143-01.18.08.184 	Gittes looks at the quilt.
0005_Chinatown_01.18.35.288-01.18.38.269 	Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn.
0005_Chinatown_01.20.11.594-01.20.15.187 	Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving.
0005_Chinatown_01.21.30.344-01.21.34.012 	Gittes looks sharply at her.
0005_Chinatown_01.21.34.012-01.21.35.709 	Then: She looks at him.
0005_Chinatown_01.31.30.823-01.31.32.987 	She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking in Spanish.
0005_Chinatown_01.32.41.272-01.32.41.363 	He looks at it and her.
0005_Chinatown_01.33.48.542-01.33.52.002 	She lifts her head and looks up at him.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.23.41.463-01.23.47.353 	Neff is in the booth dialing a number, and as she waits he looks around to make sure he is not watched.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.23.59.254-01.24.02.303 	Phyllis steps out and goes into the market, looking around.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.24.29.655-01.24.30.782 	Phyllis looks at him sharply, sideways.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.26.29.264-01.26.31.470 	Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and looks at him with cold, hard eyes.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.26.41.823-01.26.59.444 	Over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the COMMENTARY.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.29.41.079-01.29.41.352 	Neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves towards him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.30.39.397-01.30.46.003 	As he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.48.856-01.32.50.330 	He walks slowly back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there looking out through the glass doors.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.47.123-01.40.49.653 	He looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.51.710-01.40.54.267 	He looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.26.386-01.42.27.550 	The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.31.637-01.43.32.590 	He looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.45.31.153-01.45.32.700 	He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.33.355-00.02.37.218 	He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another Tonga that pulls up just behind his.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.46.050-00.02.47.016 	Apte and Karkare look back at him.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.56.695-00.06.57.492 	He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.23.200-00.09.27.993 	Singh, slighter and older than Khan, but wiry and looking capable of physical as well as intellectual strength, and Khan's twenty-year-old son, Tyeb Mohammed.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.29.585-00.09.31.767 	Gandhi looks around helplessly.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.48.434-00.09.52.677 	Gandhi looks at Mr. Baker almost in disbelief.
0011_Gandhi_00.10.14.846-00.10.16.825 	Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.24.420-00.13.26.521 	He looks at the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_00.17.45.414-00.17.48.058 	He looks back at the cab in confusion, then signals the driver to follow and hurries on to match strides with Gandhi's brisk pace.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.53.427-00.18.54.128 	He pauses, looking at the youth.
0011_Gandhi_00.19.11.285-00.19.12.384 	A woman is leaning out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.41.460-00.22.44.145 	Walker looks around, grinning, shaking his head.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.50.201-00.22.52.704 	Walker looks at him appraisingly.
0011_Gandhi_00.23.05.305-00.23.06.594 	Ba looks at him coldly.
0011_Gandhi_00.24.01.741-00.24.03.077 	Now Ba looks at him hostilely.
0011_Gandhi_00.25.10.057-00.25.11.097 	Gandhi looks up at her, blankly, abjectly.
0011_Gandhi_00.25.44.625-00.25.46.658 	Gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her.
0011_Gandhi_00.25.46.658-00.25.49.431 	She looks at him evenly -- no smile, but the warmth still in her eyes.
0011_Gandhi_00.26.14.073-00.26.15.186 	Gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view, ending with two plainclothes European policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row.
0011_Gandhi_00.26.13.826-00.26.15.232 	When is subsides Gandhi looks down at the plainclothes policemen, fixing his gaze on them.
0011_Gandhi_00.27.50.746-00.27.57.095 	The police half rise to look back at him, but there is a smattering of applause and several stand to look back.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.23.409-00.28.23.539 	He looks at the audience.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.45.727-00.28.46.477 	He looks down at the police, making the point stick.
0011_Gandhi_00.30.07.794-00.30.11.342 	He looks at the audience.
0011_Gandhi_00.30.55.101-00.30.58.220 	Gandhi looks at the full theater -- all standing.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.27.208-00.32.29.354 	He looks from Gandhi to the miners.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.39.561-00.34.41.501 	Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed are looking off at the retreating horses.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.34.374-00.36.36.552 	Gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages, the defiant, determined faces.
0011_Gandhi_00.38.20.172-00.38.21.721 	Smuts looks at Gandhi, a little surprised at the frigid tone of that refusal.
0011_Gandhi_00.41.14.075-00.41.18.075 	The prison guard appears in the doorway, looking off in confusion at Gandhi, then back at the office for guidance.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.01.275-00.42.07.377 	The second Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down again.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.17.902-00.43.20.091 	Gandhi looks around at the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.50.869-00.43.51.974 	The crowd still surges around and Gandhi is looking apprehensively back for Ba.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.54.216-00.43.54.911 	With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car pulls off.
0011_Gandhi_00.45.42.948-00.45.44.465 	Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah, now he looks a little startled at Prakash.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.50.110-00.46.52.267 	Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently, penetratingly.
0011_Gandhi_00.48.06.966-00.48.12.374 	He pauses and looks at Gandhi -- and for the first time he smiles.
0011_Gandhi_00.51.26.155-00.51.27.977 	The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on another.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.36.178-00.54.38.106 	Ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.01.463-00.59.04.790 	Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.16.719-00.59.17.859 	Nehru is looking a little harassed, from the ragging he is taking and from the ride.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.17.859-00.59.19.427 	The ashram is only half-finished, the ground unworked, the buildings only partially completed and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.30.950-00.59.34.896 	He looks around the ashram a little dismally.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.44.098-01.01.44.308 	He looks off.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.46.351-01.02.48.825 	He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.59.179-01.03.01.897 	He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying desperately not to show it.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.43.431-01.04.45.591 	Then he looks around at the crowd, suspiciously, a touch of inner fear, then back to Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.19.041-01.05.21.709 	He looks around, then turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.44.014-01.05.44.970 	We feature a man in middle age, but one who looks ill and drawn (Meha).
0011_Gandhi_01.06.28.248-01.06.29.948 	Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling, almost nothing remains.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.56.699-01.06.00.328 	And finally Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, the two women listening together but Meha's wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead and hardly combed, her sari dirty.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.58.871-01.08.00.624 	He has looked up.
0011_Gandhi_01.08.43.371-01.08.44.607 	The captain looks at his clerical collar, his English face, his determination.
0011_Gandhi_01.09.01.456-01.09.04.988 	He looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head.
0011_Gandhi_01.10.22.505-01.10.26.609 	Gandhi looks up -- his anger, his determination there, but then broken by a hopeless sigh.
0011_Gandhi_01.12.48.749-01.12.52.033 	The magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too aware of the mob outside.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.30.583-01.13.35.591 	In the chaos of cheering and delight, the magistrate rises, looks around the room and heads for his chambers.
0011_Gandhi_01.14.25.877-01.14.28.755 	It sounds casually ironic, but they look determined, even angry.
0011_Gandhi_01.14.57.242-01.14.57.849 	Sir George looks at him -- half defensive, half defiant.
0011_Gandhi_01.15.23.064-01.15.24.584 	Sir George looks at him and sighs heavily.
0011_Gandhi_01.15.28.959-01.15.30.716 	Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward.
0011_Gandhi_01.15.58.344-01.16.00.655 	Sir George looks at the document on the secretary's desk.
0011_Gandhi_01.16.03.428-01.16.05.276 	Sir George looks at it like a snake.
0011_Gandhi_01.17.47.671-01.17.48.481 	He looks at Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.14.401-01.19.15.707 	They all look at him with some surprise.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.30.681-01.19.38.134 	As it sinks in, Gandhi pours some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -- first to Jinnah.
0011_Gandhi_01.21.58.550-01.22.02.792 	Grimly, Lord Chelmsford looks out across the palace's ordered lawns and gardens.
0011_Gandhi_01.23.01.375-01.23.04.611 	Gandhi, who also looks worn, rises his eyebrows whimsically at the use of that name.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.30.146-01.25.31.154 	Dyer looks ahead calmly.
0011_Gandhi_01.26.33.371-01.26.34.739 	looking off at The speaker -- medium shot.
0011_Gandhi_01.28.00.944-01.28.02.257 	He looks off at the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_01.29.24.043-01.29.25.342 	The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief -- more at his attitude than his statement.
0011_Gandhi_01.30.42.770-01.30.44.438 	Dyer looks at him quickly.
0011_Gandhi_01.35.52.627-01.35.56.877 	Gandhi and the others just look at him.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.09.291-01.37.12.779 	He looks at them all, then up at Lord Chelmsford behind them.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.51.382-01.39.00.308 	Gandhi fiddles with his glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but quite definitely, the crowd stills.
0011_Gandhi_01.40.10.776-01.40.12.690 	Now he looks out across them as though seeking something.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.09.739-01.41.14.153 	They look at each other with a kind of fear a rampant crowd can excite in those who must hold it.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.30.104-01.41.32.424 	Despite the Indian tunic he now wears he cannot help but look and act like the incisive, patrician lawyer he is under the skin.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.26.205-01.43.29.832 	Gandhi looks up at Azad, Azad shakes his head solemnly.
0011_Gandhi_01.44.05.175-01.44.07.115 	For a moment he looks at her sari.
0011_Gandhi_01.44.39.392-01.44.41.022 	Mirabehn nods and looks resignedly at Ba.
0011_Gandhi_01.44.44.748-01.44.46.405 	Mirabehn looks at her, accepting the warmth behind the teasing.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.53.798-01.45.54.997 	One policeman looks up.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.27.659-01.47.30.052 	Patel leans with one arm on a table, his mood as devastated as Gandhi's; he is looking at an Indian paper on the table by his hand.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.46.935-01.47.49.012 	He looks at him.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.57.056-01.47.57.631 	Patel looks up hopelessly at Jinnah.
0011_Gandhi_01.48.09.911-01.48.11.770 	He looks at Gandhi with a mounting sense of annoyance.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.08.082-01.49.12.754 	Gandhi looks up at him -- a resigned fatalism.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.30.472-01.49.33.198 	He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps, and nods.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.33.435-01.50.38.050 	Then Ba straightens, and leaves without looking back.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.50.845-01.50.53.739 	She looks at him nervously, then pours a glass from the pitcher.
0011_Gandhi_01.51.17.163-01.51.20.469 	Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability.
0011_Gandhi_01.51.52.720-01.52.04.342 	She bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.03.520-01.55.11.629 	He looks at Gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to Gandhi's side.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.35.134-01.56.35.503 	He looks around, a little surprised, a little affected by the demonstration.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.35.503-01.56.36.142 	He looks up at the judge.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.53.212-01.57.54.586 	He looks up at Gandhi and his own respect for him is almost poignantly manifest.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.27.016-01.58.33.735 	He folds, and refolds his glasses and then without looking at anyone he rises.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.57.012-01.58.59.078 	He is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees.
0011_Gandhi_01.59.59.014-02.00.00.581 	He is looking straight ahead.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.46.722-02.01.51.666 	Walker comes to his side, looking out over the bay and city, truly impressed.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.53.472-02.01.55.172 	Walker looks down at him.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.03.625-02.03.08.589 	He looks out to sea, and we intercut his face with Walker's, the sea, and the town itself as the sun turns it white.
0011_Gandhi_02.02.35.867-02.02.38.984 	Walker stares at him, then at what Gandhi seems to be looking at.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.53.047-02.03.54.985 	Gandhi looks at him, a teasing smile.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.21.366-02.04.22.452 	He is looking in astonishment at his principal secretary.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.38.782-02.04.41.187 	Irwin looks at him, still trying to penetrate the significance of the act.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.59.700-02.05.04.287 	Irwin looks at his ADC, then paces a bit, pondering it.
0011_Gandhi_02.06.55.874-02.06.56.912 	Gandhi grins, looking at Mirabehn, who is massaging his legs.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.16.454-02.08.21.765 	Walker stops, letting the procession march on by him, looking at the British police officer, then writing busily in his notebook.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.49.421-02.08.51.095 	He looks at Walker, walking along a few paces behind him, at the side of the procession.
0011_Gandhi_02.13.18.130-02.13.21.135 	He looks at Irwin and the principal secretary for a moment in uncertainty.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.16.506-02.15.17.772 	He watches, looking tensely from one group to the other, almost terrified by what seems about to happen.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.24.650-02.24.28.593 	He stops and looks at Patel.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.30.708-02.24.32.100 	He looks at Jinnah and shrugs.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.51.974-02.24.55.853 	Gandhi stops, looks up at him, at the troops behind him.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.23.400-02.25.24.530 	He looks flummoxed.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.21.061-02.26.23.944 	He is spinning in a shaft of light -- and looking off -- as we hear a camera click and the rustle of movement.
0011_Gandhi_02.28.14.885-02.28.19.473 	a guard on the wall distantly looks at them wonderingly.
0011_Gandhi_02.29.44.962-02.29.48.719 	She looks at him in surprise and he sighs tolerantly.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.01.843-02.31.09.129 	She looks at them soberly and then they all burst into laughter like girls.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.52.816-02.31.56.397 	Gandhi looks up at him.
0011_Gandhi_02.32.42.419-02.32.45.279 	He looks across at Mirabehn and nods for her to go.
0011_Gandhi_02.32.54.239-02.32.57.009 	He looks back.
0011_Gandhi_02.35.52.204-02.35.56.318 	Nehru and Patel are approaching from the conference room, both of them looking worn and angry too.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.19.817-02.37.21.076 	The youths -- and Kallenbach -- look back toward the ashram.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.48.675-02.37.50.488 	Gandhi looks down at Abha, and taps her sharply on the top of the head.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.42.457-02.38.44.896 	Gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.31.171-02.39.31.306 	He is looking down in a slightly supercilious manner.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.23.558-02.39.26.909 	He has been looking at Gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.22.342-02.40.24.020 	Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.47.478-02.45.52.191 	Gandhi turns, looks at him bleakly.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.22.599-02.48.29.951 	He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.10.676-02.52.11.490 	Nehru looks across at Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.26.535-02.52.28.236 	Gandhi looks up at Suhrawardy, who nods.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.34.276-02.52.36.411 	Gandhi looks back at Nehru.
0011_Gandhi_02.53.00.296-02.53.04.336 	Nehru looks at him hopelessly.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.42.554-02.54.47.142 	Gandhi is looking at him, testing, not giving or accepting anything that is mere gesture.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.41.31.488-00.41.33.059 	He looks her over.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.42.46.459-00.42.49.478 	George stops, startled, and looks up.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.43.05.743-00.43.08.657 	George looks surprised at this.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.43.25.522-00.43.26.677 	Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.45.30.854-00.45.32.893 	He looks at his watch, as though about to leave.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.49.34.085-00.49.38.614 	As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.07.21.831-01.07.30.148 	They slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.20.29.042-01.20.34.153 	He sees the envelope, looks inside at the money.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.20.45.623-01.20.47.335 	He starts thumping his pockets, with increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the floor.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.20.49.499-01.20.50.488 	He looks puzzled, thinks hard, then a look of concern creeps into his eyes.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.22.16.856-01.22.19.760 	She looks at him, then says a strange thing.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.22.42.145-01.22.44.551 	As George opens the door he sees Uncle Billy frantically looking for the missing envelope.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.22.48.939-01.22.52.647 	George stops short, suddenly aware of the tragic old eyes looking up at him.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.23.07.803-01.23.09.565 	Then he goes to the cash drawer in the counter, and looks through it.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.30.51.554-01.30.55.350 	George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.31.52.236-01.31.58.937 	He looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of the house.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.37.44.331-01.37.55.330 	George gets out to look at the damage, and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.37.57.419-01.37.58.080 	George stands dully looking at the damage.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.37.58.426-01.37.58.902 	The owner comes up, looking at his tree.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.38.55.826-01.39.06.132 	He leans over looking at the water, fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as though about to jump.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.39.09.739-01.39.12.289 	George looks down, horrified.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.39.50.529-01.39.52.789 	This is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night shirt with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at the neck with a drawstring.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.40.23.703-01.40.24.771 	George looks up, surprised.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.40.49.151-01.40.52.199 	George casually looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.41.35.828-01.41.38.040 	From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest cop.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.41.54.742-01.41.56.898 	He looks up at Clarence standing beside him.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.45.35.734-01.45.41.023 	George looks around, but his car is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.50.57.328-01.51.00.166 	He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.51.06.275-01.51.17.009 	George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.52.45.949-01.52.52.000 	George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.53.59.977-01.54.02.749 	He looks around and sees Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.55.00.345-01.55.02.688 	George gets out and looks at the house.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_02.00.00.478-02.00.01.577 	She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self- satisfied and efficient.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_02.00.06.122-02.00.09.017 	She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues on.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_02.01.21.475-02.01.28.005 	He is frantically looking for Clarence.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_02.03.26.229-02.03.30.855 	George runs off as Potter looks up from his work.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_02.07.43.403-02.07.56.429 	Carter, the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_02.09.12.747-02.09.13.655 	He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.05.46.481-00.05.51.362 	Everett looks desperately about.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.06.07.449-00.06.10.602 	Both men look interrogatively to Delmar.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.06.10.602-00.06.15.332 	He looks from Pete to Everett, and nods agreeably.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.06.27.183-00.06.31.274 	The men turn in unison to look up the track.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.06.18.695-00.06.20.841 	The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.15.08.334-00.15.09.308 	Everett and Delmar are looking at the engine.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.16.20.680-00.16.22.295 	Pete looks at the watch, puzzled.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.21.34.169-00.21.39.198 	Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls out.

0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.37.07.424-00.37.13.422 	Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's retreating back.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.40.54.585-00.41.00.099 	- A high shot looking down through the rain past the dripping eave of a barn, under which Everett, Pete and Delmar have taken cover.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.41.26.063-00.41.28.324 	The three hold their coats pinched shut at the neck as they look forlornly up at the weather.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.49.24.263-00.49.26.094 	We are looking over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man in a cream-colored suit and a shirt with powder-blue collar.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.49.26.623-00.49.30.945 	Sensing something, he looks up, cocks his head, and then slowly turns to look back.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.49.30.945-00.49.34.409 	He thus reveals a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue trim; his good eye is looking intently off - at Everett and Delmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.52.00.471-00.52.02.368 	As he settles back Eckard looks around the table and helpfully relays.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.54.03.698-00.54.05.038 	Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.55.40.134-00.55.41.337 	Cooley looks up.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.55.46.801-00.55.50.972 	He looks back down at Pete.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.55.54.517-00.56.00.898 	He shrugs, looks off.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.57.02.687-00.57.05.566 	His voice trails away as he looks out at the road.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.57.23.451-00.57.24.137 	The prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.57.19.528-00.57.21.392 	The last man in line swings his pick and, as he grows smaller, looks up.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.05.42.289-01.05.44.684 	Everett and Delmar, and the rest of the sparse audience, look restively about.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.08.09.916-01.08.13.987 	With his mouth forming an O around his dropping cigar, Pappy looks sadly from one to the other, like a spectator at a particularly boring tennis match.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.11.03.807-01.11.07.356 	He hugs Everett, who looks profoundly uncomfortable.

0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.18.49.599-01.18.51.532 	Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.18.55.800-01.18.57.145 	As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.18.55.487-01.19.00.102 	WHOOOOSH - As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward Big Dan, frozen, looking up.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.23.44.954-01.23.46.562 	She shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate as Everett continues pleading to her back.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.24.20.440-01.24.25.510 	Everett, still trying to get Penny's attention, looks up, stunned at the ovation.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.27.19.554-01.27.21.902 	They look at each other wordlessly, look back at the crystal set.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.27.21.902-01.27.25.415 	Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks apprehensively on.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.35.19.773-01.35.20.981 	They look to Cooley for guidance.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.39.29.048-01.39.29.757 	Dazed, they look around.
0017_Pianist_00.02.50.894-00.02.54.807 	She can barely control her tears and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens and Szpilman enters, looks round bemused by the activity.
0017_Pianist_00.12.31.921-00.12.32.593 	He looks at it.
0017_Pianist_00.12.36.914-00.12.53.195 	She looks over his shoulder and reads.
0017_Pianist_00.13.16.735-00.13.21.561 	They look at each other puzzled, then Halina opens a door and looks in.
0017_Pianist_00.16.00.264-00.16.03.556 	He looks back, but Dorota is lost to sight and the procession continues on its way.
0017_Pianist_00.16.41.787-00.16.47.110 	They all go to the window and look out.
0017_Pianist_00.23.11.150-00.23.16.505 	Szpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore, who makes eyes at him.
0017_Pianist_00.25.42.931-00.25.44.842 	Two women appear from a doorway, approach the wall and look up.
0017_Pianist_00.26.01.118-00.26.07.709 	Szpilman walks on, hears a noise, looks back to see a SECOND CHILD trying to wriggle through the same hole.
0017_Pianist_00.24.12.479-00.24.15.314 	He laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers.
0017_Pianist_00.27.42.665-00.27.44.602 	The others look at him.
0017_Pianist_00.30.46.168-00.30.46.777 	He looks as though he's getting away.
0017_Pianist_00.38.54.888-00.38.57.542 	The small office is on an upper level with a window looking down on the factory floor where Jewish men and women are hard at work on sewing machines making the terrible clatter.
0017_Pianist_00.44.49.442-00.44.53.161 	Everyone looks towards the gates.
0017_Pianist_00.46.13.930-00.46.15.813 	Halina looks at him in disbelief.
0017_Pianist_00.50.23.316-00.50.25.218 	Father is looking around, bewildered.

0017_Pianist_01.16.47.379-01.16.49.538 	Some read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the windows, but never looking at the Poles.
0017_Pianist_01.17.27.345-01.17.30.447 	Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, looks out.
0017_Pianist_01.23.38.971-01.23.40.518 	she turns to look again out of the window.
0017_Pianist_01.26.09.316-01.26.13.721 	He cautiously goes to the window and looks out.
0017_Pianist_01.27.44.015-01.27.47.551 	The hammering continues as Szpilman stumbles into the room, looks around, confused, not knowing what to do.
0017_Pianist_01.31.13.415-01.31.15.421 	She looks away.
0017_Pianist_01.32.10.601-01.32.12.736 	He and Dorota look at him.

0017_Pianist_01.44.14.849-01.44.16.719 	One of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his shoulder.
0017_Pianist_01.44.52.379-01.44.55.233 	Szpilman watching from his window, looks in the opposite direction and sees smoke rising.
0017_Pianist_01.44.55.233-01.45.01.120 	When he turns back to look towards the T-junction, he sees a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poking out from a window in the next-door building but on the floor below.

0017_Pianist_02.16.14.924-02.16.21.688 	Szpilman looks around, hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly.

0017_Pianist_02.20.43.996-02.20.51.735 	Szpilman and Lednicki looking around an empty field.

0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.18.44.164-00.18.45.898 	Jules just looks at him.

0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.44.723-01.00.50.083 	The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.50.083-01.00.55.345 	Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice.

0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.22.30.841-01.22.33.059 	She looks at him for a moment.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.29.20.640-01.29.25.558 	Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.35.16.199-01.35.22.681 	Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.36.29.108-01.36.34.511 	Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.38.44.865-01.38.49.863 	Butch and Marsellus look around the room.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.38.43.818-01.38.49.061 	After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.41.31.807-01.41.34.773 	Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.42.20.500-01.42.26.441 	Butch looks at The Gimp.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.45.55.298-01.45.58.461 	Butch looks hard at Zed.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.46.22.698-01.46.24.721 	Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used shotgun shell.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.50.45.291-01.50.46.445 	Butch looks at her.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.01.34.285-02.01.40.361 	The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.02.29.447-02.02.30.954 	He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.10.40.611-02.10.43.833 	They look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.22.41.879-02.22.45.382 	Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at Pumpkin.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.23.23.962-02.23.26.131 	Pumpkin looks at him.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.25.54.216-02.26.06.963 	Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.26.16.839-02.26.18.562 	She looks back.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.00.48.965-00.00.53.928 	HI obliges, but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his eye.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.03.07.519-00.03.09.127 	Hi looks sheepish.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.06.13.019-00.06.14.790 	Ed looks up from her camera, having just snapped a picture of another suspect against the hatched wall.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.07.20.893-00.07.21.912 	Both are wearing sunglasses, looking at the setting sun.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.08.37.391-00.08.41.847 	His face still deadly neutral, the agent looks back down at the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet, revealing it to be a couple feet long.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.08.52.651-00.08.56.285 	He looks from Ed out to the road.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.09.33.994-00.09.35.442 	He looks to the side.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.10.35.662-00.10.37.620 	He flips the paper over to look at the headline.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.10.41.581-00.10.42.332 	They look from the paper to each other.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.11.53.473-00.11.54.684 	Florence stops reading and looks up at the ceiling.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.12.10.387-00.12.12.981 	As he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title is supered beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.12.24.390-00.12.24.604 	Florence looks up at the ceiling.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.19.21.579-00.19.32.564 	The baby looks goggle-eyed at each one.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.23.30.540-00.23.30.979 	He looks up, alarmed.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.23.32.363-00.23.32.536 	He looks around.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.24.39.602-00.24.40.755 	Hi and Ed look at each other uncomfortably.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.25.46.627-00.25.48.379 	He is looking at the baby.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.25.53.134-00.25.54.247 	Gale, Evelle, and Hi look up at Ed, dumbstruck.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.26.00.475-00.26.02.977 	She looks at Hi.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.26.30.206-00.26.30.671 	Still looking at his thumb.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.28.36.798-00.28.38.659 	Only now we are no longer in the desert: We are looking down a twilight street at the end of which is the Arizona house.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.28.47.899-00.28.49.158 	We are left looking at the empty street and the faraway Arizona house.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.30.00.374-00.30.02.299 	of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken: We are looking over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder as he stands at his open front door, facing a battery of press people who stand out on the porch.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.34.31.619-00.34.32.641 	He looks at Ed, who is motioning to gale and Evelle with her eyes.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.34.43.998-00.34.45.876 	Gale and Evelle are looking dumbly from Ed to Hi.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.36.25.429-00.36.27.685 	She hides her face in her hands and looks away as if blinded, then sneaks a look around her hands.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.37.16.769-00.37.17.291 	Hi looks down.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.37.25.909-00.37.29.830 	Hi looks over at the TV, which the bam-shouting six-year-old is banging with his stick.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.38.07.326-00.38.12.547 	Hi is looking at another child who is just finishing off the T in FART in crayon on the wall.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.38.12.547-00.38.14.374 	Glen chuckles, looking at his errant child.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.38.53.809-00.38.54.746 	Glen looks around.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.39.47.614-00.39.51.018 	Dot is looking offscreen.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.41.43.477-00.41.43.599 	Hi stops also, looking at Glen, Still puzzled.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.41.49.504-00.41.51.702 	He looks around as if to make sure they are not being overheard.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.42.31.322-00.42.35.946 	Glen is looking back over his shoulder to shout at Hi as he runs.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.44.06.881-00.44.07.513 	He is looking up from a dirty magazine, reacting in horror to something approaching.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.44.34.029-00.44.34.888 	Ed hooks an arm around the seat and looks behind the car, then looks forward.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.45.07.552-00.45.08.126 	Hi looks around the parking lot, bewildered.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.45.08.502-00.45.09.623 	Hi looks behind him at the plate-glass front of the store, where a bullet pock mars the glass.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.47.56.746-00.47.56.975 	They look up as Hi rushes by.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.48.30.865-00.48.32.888 	Tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each perpendicular lane, searching for something.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.50.49.519-00.50.55.166 	They look up, dumbstruck and mortified, from the sofa where the have been watching TV.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.57.21.845-00.57.26.456 	We are craning up over the Biker's back to reveal what he is looking at: We are on a bluff overlooking the trailer park.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.58.15.335-00.58.16.343 	The door swings open and Nathan stands looking in, his middle- aged secretary hanging at his elbow.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.58.23.966-00.58.25.883 	Eyes on the Biker he slams the door shut behind him, looking for some reaction.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.58.36.922-00.58.39.109 	When the Biker speaks it is still without looking at Nathan, and with a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.00.18.475-01.00.21.581 	Nathan is looking at him stonily.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.01.37.651-01.01.39.549 	He swivels back, looking up, and his speech stops short.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.01.43.084-01.01.43.771 	Hi looks up.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.02.35.209-01.02.37.336 	Hi is looking at him evenly.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.03.50.035-01.03.52.890 	Hi looks back at the trailer.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.07.21.757-01.07.31.013 	Evelle is looking down at the baby, shifting him in his lap.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.07.31.410-01.07.32.839 	Gale looks over.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.07.48.522-01.07.52.776 	Evelle, beaming, looks up from the baby to Gale.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.08.27.119-01.08.28.604 	He is looking around at the other impulse purchases displayed by the register; he unhooks a bag of balloons.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.09.17.569-01.09.20.113 	Gale is looking around, puzzled.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.09.23.241-01.09.24.420 	The two men look at each other.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.09.24.420-01.09.26.442 	The two men's heads whip around to look in the back seat.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.09.26.520-01.09.26.915 	They look at each other in horror.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.09.26.915-01.09.28.775 	The two men's eyes widen as they remember at the same time: both look up at the roof of the car.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.11.13.479-01.11.17.065 	Hi looks over at Ed, glum but trying to be kind.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.13.50.411-01.13.52.347 	Sitting in the front seat of their idling car, looking at the bank.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.14.01.154-01.14.02.457 	They look at each other.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.14.53.552-01.14.55.740 	He is looking in shock at the tellers' counter.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.15.24.354-01.15.25.319 	The camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad car, looking past its flashing gumballs.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.16.16.511-01.16.16.663 	They look at each other.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.16.16.663-01.16.18.463 	They both twist frantically to look in the back seat.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.16.47.931-01.16.55.982 	Ed is running over to Gale and Evelle's car, throwing open the back door to look for the baby but coming out only with Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.16.55.982-01.16.56.945 	Evelle is staggering around in shock, looking in disbelief at his own blue body.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.18.20.222-01.18.21.893 	Hi looks around, reaches and pulls Ed down beneath him just as: KA-BOOM!
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.18.40.714-01.18.41.646 	He weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the street.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.18.52.916-01.18.55.562 	Hi looks up the road.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.19.47.319-01.19.47.780 	With a whipcrack effect he looks left, then right.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.22.00.013-01.22.00.869 	He looks down.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.22.53.674-01.23.02.967 	Hi and Ed looking sadly down at the baby.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.24.59.204-01.24.59.375 	She stands looking into the crib.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.25.52.271-01.25.55.441 	Nathan looks at her.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.28.15.768-01.28.19.960 	Five three-year-olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on.
0021_Rear_Window_00.04.20.941-00.04.22.033 	He looks up, expectantly.
0021_Rear_Window_00.05.42.152-00.05.43.256 	She looks up in the direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts the volume of her hearing aid.
0021_Rear_Window_00.06.06.343-00.06.07.753 	It irritates Jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music.
0021_Rear_Window_00.06.57.280-00.06.58.593 	The salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.02.996-00.08.06.344 	She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.18.902-00.08.21.052 	He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.39.526-00.08.39.709 	It is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse.
0021_Rear_Window_00.10.29.127-00.10.30.964 	She takes out the thermometer, looks at it.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.13.614-00.14.15.481 	Jeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady, and the man with the flowers.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.23.496-00.14.24.698 	She is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.28.287-00.14.28.706 	He is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.57.582-00.14.59.894 	He looks back into the room, and beckons her to come out.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.22.573-00.15.24.117 	Then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the open window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.25.665-00.15.27.091 	They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.34.232-00.15.36.127 	He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her.
0021_Rear_Window_00.16.10.847-00.16.13.980 	He looks up.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.04.403-00.17.08.901 	Jeff looks across the room at her.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.31.184-00.17.32.298 	She looks down at the long mahogany table beside her which is littered with a number of his personal effects.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.38.254-00.17.41.279 	As she talks her eyes scan the table as if she's looking for something specific.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.56.690-00.17.58.192 	Lisa finds what she has been looking for.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.57.735-00.18.01.064 	She turns to look at him, and moves toward him, carrying the cigarette box.
0021_Rear_Window_00.19.28.469-00.19.32.431 	Carl, without looking at the money, puts it in his pocket.
0021_Rear_Window_00.20.41.804-00.20.43.349 	She looks up at him with a serious frankness.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.26.229-00.21.28.873 	Jeff gives a sigh of relief, exhaling his breath, then looks down toward his legs in thought.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.32.402-00.23.32.602 	Jeff, his glass in hand, looks out sympathetically.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.03.315-00.24.05.838 	He looks at his watch with some impatience, and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the time.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.21.753-00.24.25.491 	She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.47.024-00.24.50.506 	There is a slight, but warm, smile on Jeff's face as he looks at the drawn shade.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.50.400-00.26.52.863 	A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.56.077-00.26.57.077 	Jeff looks at her soberly.
0021_Rear_Window_00.28.12.161-00.28.13.161 	She looks at him for a moment without speaking.
0021_Rear_Window_00.28.25.050-00.28.31.055 	Lisa, still looking out into the room, and without turning, says.
0021_Rear_Window_00.28.42.993-00.28.43.476 	She turns at last, and looks across at him.
0021_Rear_Window_00.30.07.174-00.30.08.493 	Jeff looks across at her with some concern.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.05.136-00.39.08.185 	The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.32.173-00.39.33.673 	He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.34.173-00.39.41.673 	Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.41.673-00.39.44.173 	THE CAMERA MOVES FORWARD, and as it reaches the edge of the window, PANS DOWN and shows us what the salesman is looking at.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.46.173-00.39.46.251 	Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman.
0021_Rear_Window_00.41.18.088-00.41.21.088 	He throws the binoculars down, and then looks about him.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.08.843-00.46.10.343 	Lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff is referring to.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.12.236-00.46.14.236 	Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.12.736-00.46.14.236 	He looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.58.629-00.47.06.129 	Lisa, still stretched out on the divan looking at Jeff, suddenly sits upright and then getting up from the divan, mover over to Jeff, THE CAMERA GOING WITH her.
0021_Rear_Window_00.49.36.503-00.49.37.003 	He is looking out of the window tensely, as THE CAMERA MOVES IN, until he is in big profile.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.06.374-00.50.09.182 	Jeff is still looking toward the salesman's apartment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.45.207-00.50.48.707 	She gets the tray of food pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.06.994-00.51.11.494 	She moves behind his chair, pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment again.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.07.204-00.51.09.204 	He looks at the breakfast, reaches for a knife and fork.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.57.030-00.51.58.030 	His eyes sort of stray around the neighborhood, and end up looking toward.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.59.530-00.52.02.530 	Jeff smiles affectionately, and starts to turn his eyes away; but something startles him, and he looks quickly back.
0021_Rear_Window_00.52.03.330-00.52.06.330 	The young husband leans his hands on the windowsill, and looks out.
0021_Rear_Window_00.52.05.830-00.52.07.830 	He looks around with some satisfaction.

0028_The_Crying_Game_01.12.56.983-01.13.01.552 	He looks at her open lips as if in disbelief at himself.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.14.31.758-01.14.33.530 	She looks at him hard.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.16.44.500-01.16.46.850 	He sees Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.18.48.507-01.18.50.057 	She looks at Col.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.19.48.180-01.19.48.681 	Fergus looks toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.21.22.814-01.21.25.960 	Several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.21.42.372-01.21.46.261 	Fergus looks from the window to the car.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.22.18.800-01.22.21.272 	Jude turns around to look at him.

0028_The_Crying_Game_01.40.20.715-01.40.21.729 	She looks like a sweet little boy.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.43.27.645-01.43.37.370 	She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front of it.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.44.56.660-01.45.01.280 	Then looks down and sees the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the house.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.45.56.627-01.46.01.900 	Among them is Dil, looking resplendent.
0029_The_Graduate_00.04.15.330-00.04.19.109 	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

0029_The_Graduate_00.16.21.436-00.16.22.203 	As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.
0029_The_Graduate_00.22.56.783-00.22.59.419 	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD down the hall.
0029_The_Graduate_00.23.23.206-00.23.27.950 	The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under.
0029_The_Graduate_00.23.46.417-00.24.14.488 	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking down into it.
0029_The_Graduate_00.25.22.045-00.25.39.129 	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby.
0029_The_Graduate_00.26.55.533-00.26.57.323 	He looks helplessly at the clerk.
0029_The_Graduate_00.27.41.555-00.27.43.760 	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been holding.
0029_The_Graduate_00.29.01.989-00.29.08.352 	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down at the center of the table.
0029_The_Graduate_00.29.09.538-00.29.11.540 	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.

0029_The_Graduate_00.32.56.199-00.33.00.222 	The desk clerk looks up.

0029_The_Graduate_00.40.47.228-00.40.48.885 	In the dining room, Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking through the doorways toward Ben.
0029_The_Graduate_00.41.43.629-00.41.51.389 	Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying her purse, passes through again and, without looking at Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and exits.

0029_The_Graduate_01.00.05.929-01.00.07.669 	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
0029_The_Graduate_01.00.07.669-01.00.10.479 	The two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at Elaine.
0029_The_Graduate_01.00.42.805-01.00.46.006 	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns back.
0029_The_Graduate_01.01.46.660-01.01.50.915 	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying to get her to look at him.
0029_The_Graduate_01.01.50.915-01.01.51.916 	She keeps looking away.
0029_The_Graduate_01.01.55.761-01.01.57.922 	People on the sidewalk are looking at them.
0029_The_Graduate_01.02.06.140-01.02.12.917 	Ben looks at her for a few moments in agony.
0029_The_Graduate_01.02.23.016-01.02.24.265 	She looks up startled.
0029_The_Graduate_01.02.42.967-01.02.47.638 	He looks at her.
0029_The_Graduate_01.08.56.450-01.09.02.269 	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.
0029_The_Graduate_01.09.49.264-01.09.54.428 	Elaine looks from Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her mother's eyes staring.
0029_The_Graduate_01.10.20.640-01.10.23.022 	Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben.
0029_The_Graduate_01.10.23.022-01.10.27.784 	He looks at her in horror.

0029_The_Graduate_01.12.18.898-01.12.20.208 	He stops and looks up.
0029_The_Graduate_01.17.14.139-01.17.25.268 	He looks at Ben searchingly, then turns and continues up the stairs and down the hall.
0029_The_Graduate_01.19.33.863-01.19.36.715 	The lady sitting next to Elaine takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben, then looks at Elaine again.
0029_The_Graduate_01.20.25.133-01.20.27.098 	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
0029_The_Graduate_01.20.34.846-01.20.35.496 	The three of them look at each other for a moment.
0029_The_Graduate_01.23.13.817-01.23.16.280 	Mr. McCleery and Ben stand and look at each other for a few seconds.
0029_The_Graduate_01.24.37.330-01.24.38.941 	He gets down on his knees and looks under the bureau.
0029_The_Graduate_01.28.50.991-01.28.56.413 	She turns and looks at him.
0029_The_Graduate_01.33.10.226-01.33.14.634 	Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr. McCleery who looks up at Ben.
0029_The_Graduate_01.33.14.634-01.33.23.774 	He walks to the door, looks out into the hall at Mr. McCleery, then shuts the door.
0029_The_Graduate_01.42.47.236-01.42.53.781 	Her face turning quickly to look up at Ben.
0030_The_Hustler_00.08.32.951-00.08.36.714 	They stand before the swinging doors and look around.
0030_The_Hustler_00.17.36.654-00.17.39.102 	Eddie looks up, with a smile.
0030_The_Hustler_00.20.23.745-00.20.26.865 	Big John looks around -- the shot seems impossible.
0030_The_Hustler_00.20.50.462-00.20.54.677 	Charlie, swallowing hard; Eddie, looking on, waiting to play;
0030_The_Hustler_00.22.27.596-00.22.28.845 	Charlie looks away, avoiding his eyes.
0030_The_Hustler_00.24.52.654-00.24.59.212 	Eddie drains the last drips from his bottle of bourbon, then looks jauntily at Bert, who now sits quietly in a chair, watching them both.
0030_The_Hustler_00.26.07.869-00.26.17.239 	Eddie, weary now, his hands resting on the table, looks up at the cool, impassive face of Bert Gordon.
0030_The_Hustler_00.29.43.653-00.29.53.238 	A drunken, exhausted Eddie nods, looks up at Bert, grins maliciously, and takes a drink.
0030_The_Hustler_00.30.07.229-00.30.13.261 	Fats emerges from the washroom, dries his hands, looks at Eddie and then at Bert who nods.
0030_The_Hustler_00.31.15.721-00.31.21.162 	Eddie looks down at his own dirty, disheveled shirt.
0030_The_Hustler_00.36.21.707-00.36.28.164 	He looks over at Charlie, asleep in the next bed.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.04.631-00.38.08.363 	Eddie looks at him, shaking his head.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.47.040-00.38.49.450 	She looks up for an instant as Eddie appears.
0030_The_Hustler_00.39.00.593-00.39.02.837 	He goes to the lunch counter, still looking at her.
0030_The_Hustler_00.39.36.645-00.39.38.312 	Eddie keeps looking at her.
0030_The_Hustler_00.41.16.865-00.41.22.381 	She looks at Eddie anxiously as she digs in her purse for the coins.
0030_The_Hustler_00.42.13.876-00.42.17.651 	As he looks around the bar he sees Sarah, alone at a back booth, sipping a highball.
0030_The_Hustler_00.48.22.494-00.48.30.059 	They stand there for a long moment: she looks away; he looks down at the floor.
0030_The_Hustler_00.50.14.956-00.50.17.597 	He looks at the money, shakes his head disgustedly, and closes his eyes.
0030_The_Hustler_00.51.04.659-00.51.07.094 	Two men, dressed in work clothes, stand around looking disgruntled.
0030_The_Hustler_00.51.49.296-00.51.50.711 	When he looks up, he sees Sarah standing nearby.
0030_The_Hustler_00.52.13.349-00.52.16.117 	She pauses and looks at him.
0030_The_Hustler_01.04.46.483-01.04.49.941 	Sarah hands Eddie his drink without looking him in the eye.
0030_The_Hustler_01.08.24.666-01.08.31.017 	He looks around at the unused pool tables, then goes to the bar.
0030_The_Hustler_01.08.46.176-01.08.49.036 	The man looks to the bartender for his answer.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.41.746-01.09.44.101 	Eddie looks at Bert.
0030_The_Hustler_01.16.52.079-01.16.55.830 	He looks up at Eddie, grinning snidely.
0030_The_Hustler_01.18.25.321-01.18.32.392 	As Eddie looks about him at the circle of silent men, each one glaring at him, his fury gives way to fear.
0030_The_Hustler_01.20.15.891-01.20.26.246 	She opens the door, then looks up to see him leaning against the wall, his arms tucked into his chest, with one hand covering the other.
0030_The_Hustler_01.22.17.387-01.22.18.923 	He looks quickly at her, without asking directly for the match.
0030_The_Hustler_01.23.59.038-01.24.02.852 	Eddie leans back on the grass and looks at Sarah.
0030_The_Hustler_01.27.32.555-01.27.34.045 	He stops for a moment to look at his hands.
0030_The_Hustler_01.29.33.011-01.29.34.710 	She has on new dress and Eddie, looking a little ill at ease, has on a suit and tie.
0030_The_Hustler_01.30.49.218-01.30.52.083 	There is a long pause as Eddie looks from the bottle to the waiter.
0030_The_Hustler_01.31.16.303-01.31.20.405 	Then Eddie looks away.
0030_The_Hustler_01.39.42.463-01.39.45.087 	Eddie, looking excited, leads Sarah through the crowd.
0030_The_Hustler_01.46.03.057-01.46.12.195 	The camera tilts upward from a Dixieland combo blaring out a bouncy tune to find Sarah, descending the stairs, looking on at the party below.
0030_The_Hustler_01.49.15.121-01.49.18.531 	Eddie looks at Sarah for a moment, then turns and walks out.
0030_The_Hustler_01.55.25.748-01.55.29.139 	Findley puffs on his cigarette as he looks at the impatient face of Bert, slouching in the chair across from him.
0030_The_Hustler_01.57.27.855-01.57.41.928 	Bert enters his suite, removes his overcoat, then looks at the door that divides his room from Sarah's.
0030_The_Hustler_02.01.55.882-02.01.57.981 	He looks at the detectives around Bert's bed.
0030_The_Hustler_02.05.50.341-02.05.54.856 	Eddie looks at the lineup of the balls.
0030_The_Hustler_02.07.50.988-02.07.56.111 	Eddie looks significantly at Fats who lowers his eyes and puffs on his cigarette.
0030_The_Hustler_02.08.40.836-02.08.43.962 	Bert looks on.
0030_The_Hustler_02.13.19.316-02.13.24.178 	Eddie just stares at Bert, then looks over at the downcast face of Minnesota Fats.
0030_The_Hustler_02.13.29.554-02.13.30.665 	Fats looks up at Eddie.
0030_The_Hustler_02.13.44.153-02.13.51.010 	He stops for a moment, looks around at the rows of empty tables, and goes out.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.04.00.604-00.04.05.503 	With what nonchalance he can muster he bends down and looks under the bed just as Wick enters, a sheaf of white paper in his hand.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.04.38.901-00.04.41.077 	She is a clean-cut, good looking girl of twenty-six.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.05.37.008-00.05.38.927 	Wick looks up.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.07.30.558-00.07.31.758 	Helen, sensing something amiss, looks from one brother to the other.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.04.910-00.08.14.780 	Don looks after him, then follows him, a stubborn smile on his lips.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.09.25.883-00.09.32.821 	Don dashes in, takes a nail file, kneels beside the grille of a register in the side wall, pries it out with the file, looks inside, puts his hand in.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.09.43.249-00.09.46.717 	He looks at the hole wide-eyed, pushes back the grille and runs out.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.11.27.086-00.11.37.723 	He looks at it, folds it neatly, pockets it, puts on his hat, then, with an afterthought, goes into the living room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.16.11.680-00.16.14.054 	Don looks off toward the table.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.26.895-00.30.28.070 	Don looks up.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.59.357-00.31.05.604 	Thirst in his eyes, he looks away from the stage, tries to concentrate on the ceiling of the Metropolitan.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.32.03.066-00.32.05.070 	As he looks at the stage, his imagination is working at top speed.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.33.15.239-00.33.16.107 	The attendant looks up from a newspaper.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.37.43.398-00.37.45.915 	She stops and looks down, as does Don.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.04.931-00.38.08.881 	Don looks at the broken bottle, then after Helen.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.40.57.494-00.41.01.404 	When he has reached the security of some potted palms, he looks back.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.41.04.528-00.41.09.049 	She looks around, sees her parents, goes up to them.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.41.15.161-00.41.26.598 	Don stands undecided, then looks around, locates the public telephone booths, steps into one of them.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.41.34.712-00.41.35.364 	He holds the phone and looks through the glass door of the telephone booth.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.46.26.029-00.46.26.921 	Don looks at the glass in Wick's hand.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.51.26.864-00.51.31.801 	Helen looks at him for a second, then takes off her hat and throws it into a nearby chair.

0038_Psycho_00.28.15.973-00.28.19.883 	He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging useless in his hand, then back to her.

0038_Psycho_00.34.51.044-00.34.55.923 	Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper.
0038_Psycho_00.35.16.814-00.35.22.115 	Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.
0038_Psycho_00.35.32.699-00.35.33.514 	Mary looks at him, with some compression, smiles.

0038_Psycho_00.44.37.137-00.44.39.734 	Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary undressing.
0038_Psycho_00.44.52.139-00.44.54.055 	He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window.
0038_Psycho_00.45.24.276-00.45.32.677 	Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, strides manfully up the path.
0038_Psycho_00.45.37.786-00.45.40.967 	We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair.
0038_Psycho_00.49.46.542-00.49.54.600 	The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice.
0038_Psycho_01.07.41.807-01.07.44.592 	Norman looks dutifully at it.

0038_Psycho_01.34.33.075-01.34.41.788 	Sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for Lila and Himself to pass through.
0038_Psycho_01.35.06.964-01.35.10.978 	She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she hears the door close, then looks about for another way to reach the house.

0038_Psycho_01.38.28.620-01.38.33.884 	Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to the room whose door is half-open.
0038_Psycho_01.41.18.590-01.41.20.353 	Lila looks at it in horror.

1005_Signs_01.00.40.919-01.00.48.057 	Holding the knife at belly level, he twists the long wide blade until he's looking at his own reflection in the polished steel.

1008_Spider-Man2_01.22.55.975-01.23.00.181 	as he looks over the parapet, one of the mechanical limbs rears up and throws him off his feet.
1008_Spider-Man2_01.24.35.524-01.24.36.057 	he stops, looks up at the fire, then steps back.

1008_Spider-Man2_01.47.07.282-01.47.17.889 	as the train hurdles towards the river, a desperate looking spider-man fires webs at buildings.

1008_Spider-Man2_02.03.16.792-02.03.19.406 	as john nuzzles her neck, mj looks across and up to the crane.
1008_Spider-Man2_02.03.31.319-02.03.39.374 	he looks at the city, then round to mj, before leaping into the night sky carried by a web.
1008_Spider-Man2_02.04.17.346-02.04.21.998 	harry looks anxiously around and stares up at the balcony surrounding the room.

1009_Spider-Man3_00.11.21.228-00.11.23.362 	he looks down at a little girl of about 10 years old asleep in bed.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.12.03.036-00.12.09.937 	he turns sharply as the light comes on and looks at a blond woman in her 40s with her arms folded, wearing a disenchanted expression.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.16.09.488-00.16.15.435 	aunt may looks down, her eyes glistening with tears, and sweeps back a lock of her white hair.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.17.43.578-00.17.53.296 	stuck in the wall, peter looks up in a daze, as the figure in dark green hovers down towards him and slides his visor back.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.19.15.931-00.19.22.134 	peter opens his fist and looks down at the ring nestled in his palm, then turns and runs as harry swoops down.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.23.01.512-00.23.13.964 	slowly, he hauls himself to his feet and looks desperately from side to side.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.23.31.180-00.23.41.173 	flint looks up nervously as the capacitors descent towards him and spin around him.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.24.34.430-00.24.42.297 	the cops arrive at the edge of the pit and look down to find the capacitors slowing down and flint nowhere to be seen.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.24.58.333-00.25.01.081 	he looks up and hurriedly stands as a doctor approaches.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.25.22.807-00.25.25.208 	the dark haired, bearded doctor goes, leaving peter looking pensive.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.25.28.597-00.25.35.315 	with a tentative step, he passes the window of a private room and looks inside.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.26.56.798-00.27.03.163 	peter looks relieved.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.27.24.202-00.27.38.827 	seen from further away, the rocks look more like gravel, and from even further away the gravel reveals itself as millions of grains of sand which sweep along the floor of the pit like waves on a beach.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.28.45.197-00.28.56.922 	he looks down at his body of sand, then holds his hands to his large, round head.

2034_Super_8_00.15.24.553-00.15.27.524 	and in the heat of it, alice looks at charles, unsure.
2034_Super_8_00.16.52.103-00.16.59.998 	joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle turns onto the tracks.
2034_Super_8_00.17.00.520-00.17.06.247 	push in on joe, unsettled -- as the train crosses them now -- joe looks back toward alice -- a blast of air, shockingly loud.
2034_Super_8_00.17.06.247-00.17.16.663 	alice and martin continue to yell their lines -- charles is almost laughing at how good this looks -- but joe looks desperately back toward the headlights -- the train lighting.
2034_Super_8_00.20.55.980-00.21.08.414 	joe looks -- they all move to preston (except cary, who heads off): crates have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing thousands of small white-metal cubes which now litter the ground.

2034_Super_8_00.31.46.487-00.31.48.196 	close on joe as he arrives beside alice, who looks out at the train, haunted.

2034_Super_8_01.02.05.525-01.02.20.836 	he moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the town water tower.
2034_Super_8_01.03.57.897-01.04.02.952 	alice gasps -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back?.
2034_Super_8_01.04.16.916-01.04.19.605 	he adjusts himself -- painfully -- then looks into the cracked-glass rear view.
2034_Super_8_01.04.19.605-01.04.22.081 	alive is still looking back at the car -- so she doesn't see the shape that is coming behind her -- and just as she decides: i'm not going back, she turns to begin riding on.
2034_Super_8_01.07.47.795-01.07.51.373 	but joe has slapped charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen -- charles looks too -- and now we see it: through the.

2034_Super_8_01.08.22.863-01.08.25.528 	mr. harkin points -- joe turns to look -- we pan: the distant.
2034_Super_8_01.09.59.943-01.10.05.205 	find joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally sees louis and hurries to him.
2034_Super_8_01.10.32.644-01.10.35.873 	and louis looks at him with hope.
2034_Super_8_01.10.38.442-01.10.41.059 	they look at him like he's from uranus.
2034_Super_8_01.11.13.852-01.11.21.205 	jen looks right as us, vulnerable, but seductive.
2034_Super_8_01.11.21.205-01.11.23.069 	now we see donny, looking right at us.
2034_Super_8_01.14.39.712-01.14.47.984 	now we cut to darkness -- we're inside the dungeon as it opens -- the boys look directly at us -- their faces say it all: the mother lode.
2034_Super_8_01.14.59.176-01.15.01.651 	we're looking down at the boys, surrounded by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16mm film cannisters and cassette tapes.
2034_Super_8_01.16.37.924-01.16.44.898 	the boys are scared as they watch the creature hold woodward tight -- lift him -- and its tentacles suddenly thrust into his nose, ears and mouth -- joe stands and looks intently at the screen.
2034_Super_8_01.19.37.208-01.19.40.873 	push past them toward our four boys, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired safety glass, all looking toward us, terrified.
2034_Super_8_01.20.35.638-01.20.41.865 	push in on cary, to closeup, looking past camera, terrified.
2034_Super_8_01.22.58.597-01.23.02.312 	somehow nelec takes this moment to look into joe's face -- to silently -- in a look -- repent.
2034_Super_8_01.24.39.675-01.24.44.602 	as the two soldiers head off, jack wraps louis' arm over his shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as louis looks him over, confused.
2034_Super_8_01.25.18.579-01.25.24.793 	donny looks at joe, like it hurts to think.
2034_Super_8_01.26.13.835-01.26.19.059 	joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting blown to shit in collateral damage.
2034_Super_8_01.28.03.157-01.28.05.163 	charles looks at martin -- can't argue.
2034_Super_8_01.28.07.531-01.28.10.338 	charles nods -- joe looks to cary.
2034_Super_8_01.28.51.402-01.29.10.571 	again and again, until finally the door kicks open -- and they almost fall inside -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking straight down from inside the shed -- the entire floor of the shed has been dug out -- dropping forty feet straight down, dirt piled, caked along the sides of the structure.
2034_Super_8_01.29.42.189-01.29.45.681 	jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road.
2034_Super_8_01.30.30.220-01.30.36.425 	dark as hell -- looks up -- at cary climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above him.
2034_Super_8_01.31.14.225-01.31.17.819 	they look up: another hole leading down, dug straight through a house.
2034_Super_8_01.31.51.377-01.31.53.301 	joe and cary look at the space in disbelief.
2034_Super_8_01.32.56.259-01.33.04.324 	joe runs, looking for another way into the creature's massive space -- he finally finds another intersection -- he turns into it -- he disappears down the tunnel.
2034_Super_8_01.33.09.651-01.33.13.410 	he sees the creature -- then looks across to the lifeless body of alice.
2034_Super_8_01.34.29.745-01.34.33.787 	she's catching her breath, nodding, looking at him, amazed.
2034_Super_8_01.41.28.280-01.41.28.955 	tears in joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go, but knowing he must.
2034_Super_8_01.41.41.302-01.41.44.247 	and joe looks at his mother -- and in this moment, she at him and jack's eyes suddenly well with tears -- alice, too, tears streaming down her face and finally jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on his son's shoulder -- which was all joe needed, really.
2034_Super_8_01.43.04.575-01.43.13.138 	and looking skyward, joe smiles.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.05.15.649-00.05.19.277 	abby looks worried.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.06.18.838-00.06.21.089 	abby stops flossing and looks at joy.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.14.04.218-00.14.05.845 	joy looks at abby.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.19.05.618-00.19.08.636 	in the control room, abby looks like she's going to pass out.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.23.59.374-00.24.01.509 	abby covers the cat's eyes, then looks away.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.23.49.862-00.23.56.785 	but a moment later, she's looking back in the window, to see -- colin step out of the shower.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.34.15.130-00.34.18.183 	she thinks, looks at the phone again.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.39.14.347-00.39.19.143 	abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and sling backs.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.43.54.067-00.43.59.074 	pans over to them and -- it looks like abby is giving colin an enthusiastic hand job.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.49.07.154-00.49.09.156 	abby looks away haughtily.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.54.13.877-00.54.19.173 	stuart watches, worried, as abby rises from underneath the table, clutching her head and looking around frantically, trying to figure out who has the remote.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.55.03.968-00.55.06.845 	candi looks at harold, intrigued by abby's display.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.02.00.981-01.02.02.862 	nearby, a confused joy looks at abby.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.14.26.286-01.14.30.789 	mike backs out of the elevator, looking shell-shocked.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.17.22.534-01.17.24.899 	he stops and looks at her.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.18.19.043-01.18.20.494 	mike looks away.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.24.15.928-01.24.19.265 	mike looks over to see -- on the tv -- live footage from the balloon fiesta.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.27.41.521-01.27.45.126 	in the basket, mike looks at the camera.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.28.01.175-01.28.02.408 	abby and mike spin around to look at him.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.28.05.514-01.28.10.381 	mike looks down to see -- they are now fifteen feet above the ground.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.29.00.492-01.29.02.855 	mike is thrown, turning to look at her.
