0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.39.137-01.25.46.790 	and as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
