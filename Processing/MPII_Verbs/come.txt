0026_The_Big_Fish_00.14.04.322-00.14.05.385 	DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.15.20.549-00.15.28.191 	He tries to say something, but no words come out.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.26.57.976-00.26.58.781 	Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.27.40.143-00.27.47.202 	Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.56.316-00.30.56.753 	A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.52.724-00.40.53.895 	Edward turns to see to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.47.45.147-00.47.59.858 	Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a quieter moment.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.06.32.415-01.06.33.557 	He hears voices coming from the bedroom.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.08.59.173-01.09.05.527 	The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.34.53.305-01.34.53.859 	Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.41.09.917-01.41.17.587 	She comes closer.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.05.05.362-00.05.06.957 	The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.07.40.777-00.07.42.990 	The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.31.07.471-00.31.08.341 	They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.24.25.451-01.24.27.193 	The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.03.28.160-00.03.30.527 	He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.07.10.293-00.07.12.688 	The blond woman comes in with a plate and some food on it.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.07.44.112-00.07.46.801 	Jude comes in, with a flashlight.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.08.33.547-00.08.35.514 	Suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.09.36.122-00.09.37.462 	She sidles closer, coming on to him.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.11.25.987-00.11.27.425 	Jude comes into view.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.22.13.632-00.22.14.640 	The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.41.03.500-00.41.06.810 	She comes toward him and fiddles with his hair.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.42.20.831-00.42.22.602 	Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.42.54.613-00.43.00.819 	Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.44.40.833-00.44.43.317 	Dil comes out of the pub.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.44.42.979-00.44.44.390 	Dave, the burly man, comes out.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.45.17.938-00.45.19.462 	A light comes on in an upstairs room.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.45.20.685-00.45.23.603 	Dil enters; we see her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of Dave coming in behind her.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.49.31.166-00.49.32.755 	The burly man comes up to her.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.50.09.983-00.50.13.598 	Fergus comes out.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.54.30.455-00.54.32.624 	Dil comes in in the darkness.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.54.33.558-00.54.40.751 	The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.57.22.631-00.57.23.810 	She comes up toward him once more.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.59.34.355-00.59.36.417 	Dave comes up behind them with his neck brace.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.03.30.456-01.03.33.650 	She comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.05.10.031-01.05.13.706 	Fergus comes out of the bathroom.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.28.26.677-01.28.29.573 	We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.39.21.468-01.39.23.432 	The elderly judge comes out.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.40.24.125-01.40.36.069 	She comes to the bed, and points the gun at Fergus's head.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.45.51.001-01.45.54.042 	Large barred doors open and a group of women come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc.
0029_The_Graduate_00.04.37.158-00.04.39.156 	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the Braddocks are moving down.
0029_The_Graduate_00.05.13.137-00.05.15.988 	Ben moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of the living room.
0029_The_Graduate_00.22.55.981-00.22.56.783 	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.
0029_The_Graduate_00.23.02.384-00.23.04.943 	Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it.
0029_The_Graduate_00.23.12.945-00.23.14.356 	Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.
0029_The_Graduate_00.25.39.129-00.25.45.500 	As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps.
0029_The_Graduate_00.42.39.785-00.42.55.118 	Ben comes through the back door, moves to the pool and dives in.
0029_The_Graduate_01.08.10.178-01.08.12.224 	Past Ben and through the windshield as the Robinson house comes closer and closer.
0029_The_Graduate_01.08.12.224-01.08.17.773 	The front door of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out, dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps, reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side and climbs in.
0029_The_Graduate_01.09.23.750-01.09.24.625 	Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door to her bedroom.
0029_The_Graduate_01.15.57.563-01.16.02.874 	Elaine comes out.
0029_The_Graduate_01.28.42.591-01.28.43.856 	Elaine comes out of the classroom.
0029_The_Graduate_01.30.28.810-01.30.34.590 	After a few moments the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben, kisses him, then runs back inside.
0029_The_Graduate_01.30.38.200-01.30.41.061 	A tall bearded MAN comes out and goes past Ben.
0030_The_Hustler_00.02.11.170-00.02.12.360 	Several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play.
0030_The_Hustler_00.15.42.221-00.15.47.071 	At his command, Ames comes to life.
0030_The_Hustler_00.34.16.573-00.34.27.966 	Eddie gropes through his pockets and comes up with a few crumpled bills.
0030_The_Hustler_00.41.49.953-00.41.50.483 	The bar is nearly empty when Eddie comes in.
0030_The_Hustler_00.47.11.326-00.47.17.975 	Then he comes out with the scotch and they walk off down the street together.
0030_The_Hustler_00.57.03.644-00.57.14.177 	He comes up behind her and puts his arms around her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.08.35.068-01.08.38.342 	A man in a business suit comes out of the back room and joins him at the bar.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.28.999-01.09.31.795 	As the cards are dealt Eddie steals a glance at the man he has come to see.
0030_The_Hustler_01.22.07.955-01.22.17.387 	He comes over to the table and, with his mouth, picks a cigarette out of the pack.
0030_The_Hustler_01.41.36.513-01.41.40.825 	He comes to the door, holding it open.
0030_The_Hustler_01.47.02.246-01.47.27.167 	she moves past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests; past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until she comes to the bar.
0030_The_Hustler_01.56.47.889-01.56.49.211 	Eddie waits for Bert to come down the stairs.
0030_The_Hustler_02.01.55.227-02.01.55.882 	Eddie comes in.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.03.46.948-00.03.49.736 	From the living room has been coming the sound of Wick opening the closet door and ransacking.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.12.462-00.08.16.893 	Don and Helen come to the door from the living room and stand watching.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.51.658-00.08.54.061 	Helen comes out quickly and taking a handkerchief from her bag, hurries past Wick into the hall.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.09.55.317-00.10.03.362 	Don comes running in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch and reaches under the side of it which was towards the wall.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.12.23.121-00.12.26.778 	Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.14.03.137-00.14.05.152 	Nat has come up with the bar towel to wipe off the wet ring left by the glass.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.14.23.336-00.14.33.756 	From the table in the background comes Gloria, headed for the powder room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.18.37.726-00.18.40.219 	Wick comes into the living room, sets down the suitcase and during the ensuing scene takes a topcoat from the closet.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.35.15.926-00.35.21.264 	Don comes back, takes the hat, starts away again.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.41.02.915-00.41.05.428 	Through one of the revolving doors comes Helen, in a new spring suit.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.42.29.906-00.42.36.124 	He switches on the light in the little entrance hall, flips his hat jauntily to a hook on the coat-rack and comes into the living room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.43.40.988-00.43.44.963 	Paying no attention to the sound of steps which has been coming from the staircase, Wick rises, puts the glass of whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, short.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.45.57.338-00.45.59.060 	Helen comes into the living room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.46.12.095-00.46.23.297 	Wick stands, the glass of whiskey in his hand, startled taut at the sight of Don who comes in, not too steady on his feet.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.46.13.697-00.46.16.650 	Helen comes back into the room, staring at Don.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.57.38.143-00.57.41.947 	The waiter comes back with the drink.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.59.52.059-00.59.54.281 	Don comes to a stop and leans heavily against an iron railing, wiping his face with his hand.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.04.24.702-01.04.26.562 	Don comes from the house with the typewriter.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.13.00.059-01.13.03.729 	From the opposite direction comes a male nurse.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.16.32.878-01.16.33.460 	It is lighted by a faint blue light, but the lights are on in the anteroom and some light comes through the glass doors.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.17.31.996-01.17.35.426 	Through the glass doors come two male nurses with flashlights.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.18.09.302-01.18.13.335 	Seen through the glass doors, a doctor comes running down the ante-room, followed by another male nurse with a cart on which are hypodermic syringes, etc.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.06.631-01.26.10.325 	Now from behind the struggling wings comes a spurt of blood.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.13.994-01.26.15.591 	From downstairs comes the barking of Mrs. Deveridge's dog.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.36.113-01.26.39.245 	From outside comes the sound of footsteps racing upstairs toward his door, then the door- bell: short, short, long short.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.28.17.129-01.28.18.626 	A shaft of light comes from the corridor.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.31.01.281-01.31.03.473 	Don is just coming from it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.31.04.223-01.31.06.381 	He walks down the street about ten steps when Helen comes up to him.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.33.28.930-01.33.30.167 	Don comes from the bathroom.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.37.58.006-01.38.00.752 	Helen comes up.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.39.28.124-01.39.30.436 	A smile of relief comes on Helen's face.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.11.699-00.11.12.068 	It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.19.06.873-00.19.11.358 	rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily, and as the cliff top at last comes within reach.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.14.656-00.22.18.755 	Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes so fast it's almost continual.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.48.829-00.22.54.873 	The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.29.328-00.23.30.243 	He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing--the Man In Black seems to be in control.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.42.707-00.29.44.999 	The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, slows.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.50.969-00.29.51.995 	The Man In Black nods and comes nearer.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.34.55.542-00.35.01.451 	The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her along.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.40.736-00.38.41.914 	She stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.46.24.252-00.46.25.170 	And as he says that, a R.O.U.S comes flying at him from off- screen.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.54.28.176-00.54.30.826 	BUTTERCUP, coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.58.28.920-00.58.31.520 	It keeps on coming as we finally.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.17.33.198-01.17.33.618 	Then these words come to us on the wind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.32.878-01.22.39.586 	And he props Westley up against a large suit of armour and takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came from.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.23.19.311-01.23.23.201 	INIGO, behind him, coming like a streak and.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.23.57.293-01.24.00.693 	INIGO, trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.39.137-01.25.46.790 	And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
0033_Amadeus_00.00.39.751-00.00.42.521 	Up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET.
0033_Amadeus_00.16.36.050-00.16.40.780 	He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him.
0033_Amadeus_00.27.57.855-00.28.03.340 	He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him.
0033_Amadeus_00.40.01.885-00.40.05.806 	As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.
0033_Amadeus_01.27.03.985-01.27.06.679 	Mozart comes out.
0033_Amadeus_01.29.59.803-01.30.01.033 	A hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits.
0033_Amadeus_02.13.21.164-02.13.26.026 	Michael Schlumberg comes in from his salon.
0033_Amadeus_02.21.46.545-02.21.48.711 	Constanze has come into the living room.
0033_Amadeus_02.34.42.290-02.34.51.441 	Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre.
0038_Psycho_00.09.56.703-00.09.57.951 	He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office.
0038_Psycho_00.18.48.668-00.18.51.540 	As she goes, we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same PATROLMAN.
0038_Psycho_00.32.24.735-00.32.29.249 	Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins.
0038_Psycho_00.32.29.249-00.32.31.612 	CAMERA FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room.
0038_Psycho_00.33.20.853-00.33.22.215 	We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered tray.
0038_Psycho_00.33.38.037-00.33.52.672 	Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, past the office, stopping only when he is close to her.
0038_Psycho_00.44.31.071-00.44.33.693 	A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the hole in the wall behind the picture.
0038_Psycho_00.47.44.466-00.47.45.097 	A hand comes into the shot.
0038_Psycho_00.49.46.542-00.49.54.600 	The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice.
0038_Psycho_01.16.34.972-01.16.36.498 	The house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall.
0038_Psycho_01.17.07.118-01.17.13.313 	We see Arbogast coming up the stairs.
