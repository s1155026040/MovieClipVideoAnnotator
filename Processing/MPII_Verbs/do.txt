0001_American_Beauty_00.30.51.329-00.30.53.263 	he knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.
0001_American_Beauty_00.59.09.223-00.59.09.787 	he seems comfortable with the silence; she doesn't.
0001_American_Beauty_01.06.11.435-01.06.14.412 	jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.45.901-01.32.47.812 	he's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.
0001_American_Beauty_01.40.31.513-01.40.35.268 	and so does the colonel.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.10.47.403-00.10.51.940 	the mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but carol interrupts her.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.45.30.031-01.45.35.037 	simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.56.850-00.46.57.207 	rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.08.34.076-01.08.35.295 	the croupier understands what rick wants him to do.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.10.28.419-01.10.29.667 	pretending not to do so, rick glances in ilsa's direction.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.38.52.341-01.38.53.995 	he then glances at laszlo, as does ilsa.
0004_Charade_00.50.45.409-00.50.47.372 	dyle stops in his tracks, pondering what to do.
0005_Chinatown_00.39.11.691-00.39.12.603 	the boy doesn't answer.
0005_Chinatown_01.31.51.869-01.31.57.417 	the girl reluctantly does.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.17.11.847-00.17.18.976 	he fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; about to pour he does a take at bess's photograph.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.19.56.910-00.19.57.499 	he does a little take.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.48.08.516-00.48.12.757 	wondering what to do next.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.08.42.046-01.08.43.509 	rachel mercilessly scrubs john; john doesn't like it; ruby washes pearl with a cloth.
0008_Fargo_00.58.12.779-00.58.13.778 	the attendant doesn't say anything.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.11.45.790-00.11.51.036 	elvis dances around in the same manner forrest did.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.30.28.514-00.30.29.460 	neff still does not answer.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.05.140-00.53.06.748 	neff still hangs back and keeps his head down, the way a man using crutches might naturally do.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.21.517-01.42.22.085 	this time zachetti allows him to do it.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.07.366-00.36.09.379 	though a few pointedly do not.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.17.575-01.07.19.884 	shukla shares the howdah with him, but does not dare break gandhi's black mood.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.18.432-01.13.20.105 	and so do the journalists.

0011_Gandhi_02.32.50.454-02.32.54.239 	patel stands, letting mirabehn pass before him and do down the corridor with azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.33.26.162-02.33.29.369 	he pauses, nods amiably to gandhi, though gandhi does not react to his presence at all.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.58.420-02.34.58.713 	the funeral pyre burns, its work almost done.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.30.58.333-00.31.01.359 	so does bo catlett for that matter.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.51.27.792-00.51.29.146 	done in cracked oils, the whole bit.

0013_Halloween_01.06.47.389-01.06.49.160 	the ghost doesn't answer.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.07.37.178-00.07.38.173 	a goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for gower.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.20.28.087-01.20.29.042 	he spreads the newspaper out in front of him, muttering as he does so.

0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.09.49.044-01.09.49.955 	as his hand chinks free, pete does not react to his newfound liberty.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.35.10.329-01.35.10.722 	so too does the drooling hound.
0017_Pianist_00.56.11.687-00.56.17.594 	the moment they do so two jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread.
0017_Pianist_01.00.31.236-01.00.37.926 	so does szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below.
0017_Pianist_01.10.42.438-01.10.44.281 	now, so do the others.
0017_Pianist_01.18.20.345-01.18.21.636 	while he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed.
0017_Pianist_01.24.04.138-01.24.05.854 	while he does so.
0017_Pianist_02.16.45.527-02.16.47.835 	so does the man.

0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.42.55.893-00.42.58.329 	mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.39.015-00.52.40.311 	imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.42.228-00.52.46.893 	she slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like vince did.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.46.893-00.52.56.424 	what do you know, she did it!
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.04.471-01.00.08.654 	then once you do, push down on the plunger.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.24.906-01.00.33.545 	vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.31.416-01.00.33.629 	lance, on this knees right beside vincent, does not know what to expect.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.51.14.991-01.51.17.573 	fabienne does climb on.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.37.19.637-00.37.25.818 	he laughs; hi doesn't react.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.39.12.180-00.39.12.557 	the two women don't seem to notice.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.47.58.893-00.47.59.303 	as he does so we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.24.37.416-01.24.39.407 	hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.12.436-00.08.15.190 	he notices her, but doesn't speak.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.56.098-00.08.57.192 	a look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.11.461-00.17.13.758 	she does a professional model's turn in the dress showing off its features.
0021_Rear_Window_01.48.03.107-01.48.03.599 	jeff still doesn't speak.
0022_Reservoir_Dogs_00.58.40.019-00.58.52.999 	mr. blonde pours the gasoline all over the cop, who's begging him not to do this.

0026_The_Big_Fish_00.31.57.310-00.32.00.759 	he didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.45.37.367-00.45.40.681 	edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.50.22.284-00.50.23.879 	and as they do, all motion freezes.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.03.29.084-01.03.31.194 	there's a titter from the students, but he doesn't notice.

0026_The_Big_Fish_01.25.52.602-01.25.54.969 	edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.37.21.240-01.37.23.151 	edward still doesn't recognize her.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.41.09.917-01.41.17.587 	does she really mean it?
0030_The_Hustler_00.16.44.148-00.16.51.941 	charlie does the same, counting the bills out one by one.
0030_The_Hustler_00.20.03.847-00.20.06.311 	so eddie does the same.
0030_The_Hustler_00.30.35.789-00.30.38.935 	so does bert.
0030_The_Hustler_01.22.18.923-01.22.24.694 	she lights it and, as she does, he glances at the sheet in the typewriter.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.28.06.260-00.28.09.022 	nat does break down and pours a drink.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.01.01.487-01.01.11.775 	after a time he brushes the tears from his eyes with his sleeve and as he does so, catches sight of something which rivets his attention, brings a half-crazed smile to his lips.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.25.23.591-01.25.28.622 	just as he does so, from the direction of the window there whirs past him a strange winged thing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.25.893-00.01.29.277 	the kid does.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.10.57.792-00.11.02.358 	and suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.35.45.247-00.35.50.933 	buttercup flinches, but does not retreat.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.39.25.961-00.39.28.574 	after a time, westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.12.06.674-01.12.06.967 	inigo does.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.16.58.848-01.17.00.370 	inigo and fezzik do.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.03.318-01.22.04.467 	then he does a most unexpected thing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.03.929-01.26.04.930 	again, inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.23.041-01.26.24.173 	but he does not penetrate inigo's defense.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.29.18.069-01.29.21.208 	humperdinck, doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.29.58.313-01.30.01.797 	prince humperdinck, and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch.

0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.32.59.665-00.33.01.467 	a hopelessly confused parrish does not respond for a moment.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.05.19.837-01.05.31.906 	she does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.53.30.603-01.53.32.379 	parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment.

1002_Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_01.25.59.583-01.26.05.124 	on his way out, slughorn stops, spins round and stares at harry, who doesn't flinch.
