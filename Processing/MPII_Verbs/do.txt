0001_American_Beauty_00.30.51.329-00.30.53.263 	he knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.
0001_American_Beauty_00.32.28.900-00.32.30.406 	finally lester turns back to ricky: what does this kid want.
0001_American_Beauty_00.36.46.516-00.36.48.570 	as she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on lester's shoulder.
0001_American_Beauty_00.37.07.274-00.37.08.400 	she seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength.
0001_American_Beauty_00.50.24.795-00.50.26.167 	lester, in a t-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new weight bench, doing bench presses with shiny new barbells.
0001_American_Beauty_00.55.03.254-00.55.06.697 	angela starts off, but jane doesn't follow.
0001_American_Beauty_00.59.09.223-00.59.09.787 	he seems comfortable with the silence; she doesn't.
0001_American_Beauty_01.06.11.435-01.06.14.412 	jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice.
0001_American_Beauty_01.26.03.234-01.26.08.393 	he opens the drawer in which we know ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom.
0001_American_Beauty_01.26.46.397-01.26.49.170 	then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.45.901-01.32.47.812 	he's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.
0001_American_Beauty_01.33.06.884-01.33.12.269 	she places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.
0001_American_Beauty_01.40.31.513-01.40.35.268 	and so does the colonel.
0001_American_Beauty_01.47.23.075-01.47.26.519 	lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.10.47.403-00.10.51.940 	the mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but carol interrupts her.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.28.109-00.21.28.366 	as they pass melvin she does not break stride, nor give him notice.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.34.17.975-00.34.23.522 	she is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.29.06.275-01.29.09.285 	carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.45.30.031-01.45.35.037 	simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.22.394-00.46.30.496 	he looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.56.850-00.46.57.207 	rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.08.34.076-01.08.35.295 	the croupier understands what rick wants him to do.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.10.28.419-01.10.29.667 	pretending not to do so, rick glances in ilsa's direction.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.11.35.906-01.11.42.851 	rick gets up, as does laszlo.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.38.52.341-01.38.53.995 	he then glances at laszlo, as does ilsa.
0004_Charade_00.12.04.109-00.12.24.988 	he begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, identifying each item as he does.
0004_Charade_00.20.16.651-00.20.18.661 	he motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so.
0004_Charade_00.32.00.777-00.32.03.398 	reggie is too busy beating them out to do anything else.
0004_Charade_00.49.18.627-00.49.19.980 	reggie, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by dyle, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to dyle.
0004_Charade_00.49.41.934-00.49.49.653 	realizing she has to do something before dyle spots her, she turns and takes the tourist's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe.
0004_Charade_00.50.45.409-00.50.47.372 	dyle stops in his tracks, pondering what to do.
0004_Charade_01.44.11.204-01.44.11.949 	reggie looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.
0005_Chinatown_00.21.07.303-00.21.08.432 	gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does.
0005_Chinatown_00.28.07.113-00.28.07.540 	she's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office.
0005_Chinatown_00.33.59.454-00.34.01.197 	evelyn looks at escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.
0005_Chinatown_00.39.11.691-00.39.12.603 	the boy doesn't answer.
0005_Chinatown_00.45.41.120-00.45.45.329 	evelyn mulwray is standing at the table as he does so.
0005_Chinatown_01.31.51.869-01.31.57.417 	the girl reluctantly does.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.07.32.367-00.07.35.501 	willa does a bewildered take, then looks again towards the cars o.s.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.17.11.847-00.17.18.976 	he fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; about to pour he does a take at bess's photograph.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.18.21.831-00.18.21.979 	all the grownups are avid for his words, which we don't hear through the glass.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.19.56.910-00.19.57.499 	he does a little take.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.31.00.658-00.31.03.032 	willa, in the darkness, does not move.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.44.47.935-00.44.49.438 	we start moving before he does.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.45.16.429-00.45.16.657 	it is on the ground; we don't see their chins.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.48.08.516-00.48.12.757 	wondering what to do next.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.53.33.382-00.53.34.065 	john is wondering what to do now.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.08.42.046-01.08.43.509 	rachel mercilessly scrubs john; john doesn't like it; ruby washes pearl with a cloth.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.13.42.792-01.13.46.755 	maybe we see -- though john does not -- the thanksgiving in her eyes.
0008_Fargo_00.58.12.779-00.58.13.778 	the attendant doesn't say anything.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.11.45.790-00.11.51.036 	elvis dances around in the same manner forrest did.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.31.59.426-00.32.03.095 	forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first bus ride to school years ago.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.42.31.486-00.42.34.954 	forrest and bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get the joke.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.45.52.206-00.45.53.027 	tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.30.28.514-00.30.29.460 	neff still does not answer.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.05.140-00.53.06.748 	neff still hangs back and keeps his head down, the way a man using crutches might naturally do.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.15.706-01.13.17.946 	she moves toward him but he does not respond.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.14.945-01.18.15.297 	neff recognizes him immediately but jackson does not look up.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.49.891-01.40.50.708 	as he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.50.943-01.40.51.273 	only then is it apparent that phyllis' shot actually did hit him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.21.517-01.42.22.085 	this time zachetti allows him to do it.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.35.027-01.43.37.738 	keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.08.818-00.03.17.373 	we do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.45.574-00.11.45.822 	she possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to do that which she would rather not.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.34.351-00.34.34.680 	full shot, the sergeant wheeling his horse, angrily -- surveying the whole of the procession as they lie sprawled on the ground, his mounted police circling in front of them, not knowing what to do.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.07.366-00.36.09.379 	though a few pointedly do not.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.52.267-00.46.54.077 	it is brusque but affectionate; we know he regards charlie as gandhi does.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.12.199-01.05.16.105 	it is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it that the captain doesn't like, but gandhi's unrelenting stare unnerves him.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.17.575-01.07.19.884 	shukla shares the howdah with him, but does not dare break gandhi's black mood.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.18.432-01.13.20.105 	and so do the journalists.
0011_Gandhi_01.21.41.650-01.21.42.394 	his firmness doesn't restore kinnoch's normal aplomb.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.30.678-01.38.38.313 	there is applause and noise, but ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind gandhi, who is talking with patel and nehru.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.50.009-01.41.52.141 	they turn back to the train and just as they do, the tall indian woman in the red sari tips a porter, taking one small bag from him and turns: mirabehn (madeleine slade) is tall, quite pretty and extremely english despite the sari.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.29.832-01.43.31.411 	but he does not go on.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.42.626-01.47.45.731 	they turn to him -- a sense of surprise, but they don't really believe he means the statement.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.16.202-02.24.20.449 	gandhi winds up what he has done, and starts to rise.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.50.467-02.26.51.780 	meaning he doesn't wear many clothes.
0011_Gandhi_02.32.50.454-02.32.54.239 	patel stands, letting mirabehn pass before him and do down the corridor with azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.33.26.162-02.33.29.369 	he pauses, nods amiably to gandhi, though gandhi does not react to his presence at all.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.58.420-02.34.58.713 	the funeral pyre burns, its work almost done.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.16.834-02.40.19.402 	they have all been taken by surprise by the offer -- and do not feel what gandhi feels.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.51.083-02.48.52.464 	he does so with effort, and at last he sees patel.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.54.377-02.55.58.681 	his face almost cracks -- it is a chink of light, but it does not illumine his darkness.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.30.58.333-00.31.01.359 	so does bo catlett for that matter.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.34.10.137-00.34.12.339 	karen looks caught, doesn't answer right away.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.41.03.589-00.41.06.930 	bo catlett smiles at him, doesn't give up the script.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.48.42.771-00.48.44.598 	yayo leans against the railing, cuts a 'now that's the way you get things done' look at the bear.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.51.27.792-00.51.29.146 	done in cracked oils, the whole bit.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.00.12.782-01.00.15.186 	chili gets within three steps of the guy and stops, but doesn't look up, keeps his eyes fixed on the man's gut.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.13.22.500-01.13.23.940 	the bear keeps staring, but doesn't say anything.
0013_Halloween_00.37.14.673-00.37.15.465 	for a moment bracket doesn't speak.
0013_Halloween_01.06.25.611-01.06.29.955 	she hears bob enter the room but doesn't look up.
0013_Halloween_01.06.47.389-01.06.49.160 	the ghost doesn't answer.
0013_Halloween_01.20.33.692-01.20.35.268 	the shape doesn't move.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.07.37.178-00.07.38.173 	a goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for gower.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.08.11.736-00.08.13.316 	george picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.09.15.904-00.09.17.528 	closeup uncle billy's left hand there are pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.21.43.311-00.22.09.412 	we see a series of shots of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.23.12.769-00.23.14.543 	george and mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.41.13.918-00.41.14.580 	he is obviously undecided as to what he wants to do.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.51.13.069-00.51.17.290 	ernie reaches over and hands george a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.20.28.087-01.20.29.042 	he spreads the newspaper out in front of him, muttering as he does so.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.22.54.594-01.22.55.520 	he does so and closes the door.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.22.59.388-01.23.05.152 	he goes directly to the safe and starts searching, but doesn't find the money.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.40.39.995-01.40.41.633 	throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing thing clarence does or says.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.56.18.725-01.56.21.753 	as he does so, clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in bert's wrist, forcing him to let george go.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.38.05.723-00.38.08.397 	pickers perform in the bed of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he pushes a broom.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.43.35.007-00.43.46.705 	strangely, the three laundresses do not answer, though they do smile at him as they continue to sing.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.07.45.142-01.07.49.377 	pete shakes his head - didn't catch it - and repeats, also overarticulating.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.09.49.044-01.09.49.955 	as his hand chinks free, pete does not react to his newfound liberty.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.35.10.329-01.35.10.722 	so too does the drooling hound.
0017_Pianist_00.12.53.195-00.12.56.228 	as she does so, the door of henryk's room opens and he stands leaning in the doorway, watching, as if amused.
0017_Pianist_00.43.00.243-00.43.01.943 	a young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not seem to take in what he's saying.
0017_Pianist_00.55.45.125-00.55.50.514 	again szpilman tries, but janina, her profile to him, doesn't see.
0017_Pianist_00.56.11.687-00.56.17.594 	the moment they do so two jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread.
0017_Pianist_01.00.31.236-01.00.37.926 	so does szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below.
0017_Pianist_01.10.42.438-01.10.44.281 	now, so do the others.
0017_Pianist_01.18.20.345-01.18.21.636 	while he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed.
0017_Pianist_01.24.04.138-01.24.05.854 	while he does so.
0017_Pianist_01.27.44.015-01.27.47.551 	the hammering continues as szpilman stumbles into the room, looks around, confused, not knowing what to do.
0017_Pianist_02.16.45.527-02.16.47.835 	so does the man.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.15.30.581-00.15.34.374 	jules is the one who does the talking.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.25.37.777-00.25.38.962 	butch does a slow turn toward vincent.

0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.39.015-00.52.40.311 	imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.42.228-00.52.46.893 	she slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like vince did.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.46.893-00.52.56.424 	what do you know, she did it!
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.57.44.307-00.57.49.741 	from here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a documentary in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.04.471-01.00.08.654 	then once you do, push down on the plunger.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.24.906-01.00.33.545 	vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.31.416-01.00.33.629 	lance, on this knees right beside vincent, does not know what to expect.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.02.06.798-01.02.14.723 	the two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.51.14.991-01.51.17.573 	fabienne does climb on.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.09.14.047-02.09.16.153 	jules and vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.33.02.117-00.33.03.497 	the biker is shaking his head; he doesn't think they went that way.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.37.19.637-00.37.25.818 	he laughs; hi doesn't react.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.39.12.180-00.39.12.557 	the two women don't seem to notice.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.47.58.893-00.47.59.303 	as he does so we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock.

0020_Raising_Arizona_01.18.14.990-01.18.15.748 	facing forward, they do not see lenny approaching again through the rear window.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.24.37.416-01.24.39.407 	hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.12.436-00.08.15.190 	he notices her, but doesn't speak.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.56.098-00.08.57.192 	a look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it.

0021_Rear_Window_00.51.53.346-00.51.55.846 	she is doing her inevitable leg practice at the same time.
0021_Rear_Window_01.02.53.943-01.02.56.060 	she seems to be trying to figure out what to do, or where to go.
0021_Rear_Window_01.33.23.255-01.33.24.022 	quickly thorwald does pick it up.
0021_Rear_Window_01.42.47.382-01.42.49.218 	jeff does, as stella gets her purse.
0021_Rear_Window_01.44.47.907-01.44.53.948 	he hangs up, and just as he does, jeff looks toward thorwald's apartment.
0021_Rear_Window_01.48.03.107-01.48.03.599 	jeff still doesn't speak.

0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.17.59.590-01.18.04.915 	when done, he sneaks over to mrs. boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles sit.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.19.56.882-01.20.06.498 	evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when -- carlos bulldozes past the aryans into the room, slamming karl into the wall and jamming a shank into karl's crotch!
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.20.35.501-01.20.37.609 	kayleigh and lenny, walking by his side, do a double take.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.41.09.490-01.41.13.611 	all evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.45.13.775-01.45.16.705 	he's still debating what to do when: andrea walks in and is startled by the unexpected sight of evan holding a huge knife.

0026_The_Big_Fish_00.13.05.831-00.13.07.392 	this time we don't cut.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.20.41.457-00.20.46.360 	as the crowd goes wild for edward, don price is the only teammate who doesn't mob him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.38.014-00.24.39.541 	karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.39.541-00.24.42.273 	after a beat, edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.31.57.310-00.32.00.759 	he didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.45.37.367-00.45.40.681 	edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.50.22.284-00.50.23.879 	and as they do, all motion freezes.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.03.29.084-01.03.31.194 	there's a titter from the students, but he doesn't notice.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.25.04.213-01.25.04.980 	angle on edward, not sure what to do.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.25.04.980-01.25.05.449 	he has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot norther.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.25.52.602-01.25.54.969 	edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.28.40.545-01.28.46.087 	her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.29.38.184-01.29.42.708 	something doesn't make sense.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.37.21.240-01.37.23.151 	edward still doesn't recognize her.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.41.01.548-01.41.05.198 	with that last job done, there's no reason for him to be staying any longer.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.41.09.917-01.41.17.587 	does she really mean it?
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.49.52.444-01.49.53.707 	he sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's coming.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.10.14.598-00.10.15.764 	so does brandt, the young man we've been listening to.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.30.10.254-00.30.25.655 	the dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.23.03.311-01.23.09.973 	the dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.44.49.524-01.44.53.749 	he eyes the dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and walter's army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.45.25.975-00.45.28.275 	she stands absolutely still as he does so.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.50.30.188-00.50.31.585 	they both bump into fergus, who just stands there and doesn't move an inch.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.23.27.220-01.23.28.934 	fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door.
0029_The_Graduate_00.58.33.040-00.58.35.540 	the car directly ahead of him does not move to the right.
0030_The_Hustler_00.16.44.148-00.16.51.941 	charlie does the same, counting the bills out one by one.
0030_The_Hustler_00.20.03.847-00.20.06.311 	so eddie does the same.
0030_The_Hustler_00.30.35.789-00.30.38.935 	so does bert.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.45.397-01.17.49.068 	he is shooting as he did at ames, rapping in his shots with perfect control.
0030_The_Hustler_01.22.18.923-01.22.24.694 	she lights it and, as she does, he glances at the sheet in the typewriter.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.04.41.474-00.04.42.295 	the indian summer day is a good ten degrees too warm for the coat, but that doesn't stop helen from wearing her beloved.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.06.54.026-00.06.56.746 	none of the three see, but we do, that it doesn't fall out the window but ricochets against the opened casement to the window sill, where it lies smouldering.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.14.40.305-00.14.40.879 	nat looks, but doesn't get it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.28.06.260-00.28.09.022 	nat does break down and pours a drink.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.05.309-00.30.13.502 	it is doing a land-office business, checking dripping umbrellas and apparel.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.37.43.398-00.37.45.915 	she stops and looks down, as does don.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.58.39.033-00.58.42.992 	the attendant doesn't get the joke but chuckles automatically and opens the door into the bar.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.01.01.487-01.01.11.775 	after a time he brushes the tears from his eyes with his sleeve and as he does so, catches sight of something which rivets his attention, brings a half-crazed smile to his lips.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.12.48.994-01.12.52.234 	the man looks at don but doesn't answer.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.25.23.591-01.25.28.622 	just as he does so, from the direction of the window there whirs past him a strange winged thing.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.32.26.759-01.32.32.376 	on it lies a revolver and the second page of a letter on which don is writing.but amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear wick: i did finish something, didn't i?
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.25.893-00.01.29.277 	the kid does.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.47.468-00.01.49.351 	he does his best to smile.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.02.51.591-00.02.53.733 	buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.06.45.090-00.06.51.148 	the crowd, and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.10.02.600-00.10.05.730 	inigo is at the helm, fezzik stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly--or do they?
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.10.57.792-00.11.02.358 	and suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.31.861-00.11.33.203 	the wind dies and as it does, something new is heard.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.12.01.548-00.12.11.182 	she's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- --and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her-- --and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- --and buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- --and the eel slithers closer, closer-- --and buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- --and now the eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.10.429-00.14.14.402 	fezzik is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.50.917-00.14.52.429 	he's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.15.42.863-00.15.59.859 	vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the rope which is tied around a great rock while inigo helps the princess to her feet and fezzik just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.04.501-00.23.04.884 	the man in black, stunned, doing everything be can to keep inigo by the cliff edge.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.51.434-00.27.53.992 	and the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.41.374-00.28.45.583 	because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.35.45.247-00.35.50.933 	buttercup flinches, but does not retreat.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.37.02.886-00.37.06.898 	and probably, if she did not hate roberts so, there would be tears.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.39.25.961-00.39.28.574 	after a time, westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.40.50.082-00.40.52.938 	and it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist, sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.41.54.338-00.41.57.810 	westley, instantly forcing buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.52.37.409-00.52.38.920 	and if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.00.48.423-01.00.49.063 	and his wagon starts, and as it does.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.12.06.674-01.12.06.967 	inigo does.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.16.58.848-01.17.00.370 	inigo and fezzik do.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.07.120-01.18.11.325 	westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.03.318-01.22.04.467 	then he does a most unexpected thing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.10.934-01.25.11.297 	his voice sounds just fine, but he does not move.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.57.239-01.26.02.973 	inigo watches the count approach, and the count flicks his sword at inigo's heart, and there's not much inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and count rugen's blade sinks deeply into inigo's left shoulder.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.39.137-01.25.46.790 	and as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.03.929-01.26.04.930 	again, inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.23.041-01.26.24.173 	but he does not penetrate inigo's defense.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.29.18.069-01.29.21.208 	humperdinck, doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.29.58.313-01.30.01.797 	prince humperdinck, and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.32.08.396-01.32.09.349 	buttercup and westley, and at last their trials are done.
0033_Amadeus_00.22.21.427-00.22.24.847 	mozart does it with a furious grace, then leaves the room.
0033_Amadeus_00.39.49.802-00.39.56.565 	cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest.
0033_Amadeus_01.02.13.086-01.02.15.387 	the court composer, oblivious to constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them.
0033_Amadeus_01.46.15.720-01.46.16.472 	we do look at them.
0033_Amadeus_02.42.46.522-02.42.49.126 	we do not hear what he is saying to salieri, who still sits writing assiduously.
0038_Psycho_00.19.01.850-00.19.12.421 	mary, engrossed in the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see the patrolman.
0038_Psycho_01.25.07.575-01.25.14.335 	suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.18.49.321-00.18.50.281 	cole does.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.30.58.603-00.31.01.773 	every now and then we get glimpses of things cole is playing with peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out what he's doing.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.38.43.812-00.38.45.004 	malcolm taps the pocket but doesn't open it.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_01.14.33.229-01.14.38.382 	sean pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_01.26.49.142-01.26.51.731 	the two children don't say anything for a while.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.13.33.713-00.13.34.805 	thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get the joke.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.21.26.506-00.21.27.395 	thelma does, too.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.28.41.237-00.28.45.619 	louise did not realize she was doing it.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.39.37.493-00.39.38.340 	so she makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.41.50.979-00.41.58.435 	the guy does seem really nice and thelma is really frustrated that louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to confront her.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.33.20.360-01.33.31.873 	louise passes him and, as she does, he honks.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.37.03.001-01.37.05.767 	louise does.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.37.42.586-01.37.43.393 	she does.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.38.43.060-01.38.48.414 	he picks up the hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun comes in his car window.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.56.54.014-01.56.56.711 	it does look like an army.
0046_Chasing_Amy_00.49.18.455-00.49.22.861 	alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does holden, who offers a puzzled shrug.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.30.50.189-00.30.54.050 	mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.43.53.459-00.44.03.444 	evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.09.00.953-00.09.03.631 	roscoe makes a grab for the cross -- but indy doesn't let go.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.33.55.234-00.34.01.238 	he steps into the water, then reaches up to help elsa do the same.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.52.52.526-00.52.54.808 	indy and henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.02.12.733-01.02.16.051 	henry looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as indy searches frantically for an exit.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.17.34.761-01.17.35.904 	henry does -- and the exploding gun nearly shakes him out of his seat.
