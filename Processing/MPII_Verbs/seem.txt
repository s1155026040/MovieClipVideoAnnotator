0001_American_Beauty_00.37.07.274-00.37.08.400 	She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength.
0001_American_Beauty_00.59.09.223-00.59.09.787 	He seems comfortable with the silence; she doesn't.
0001_American_Beauty_01.14.47.184-01.14.47.434 	The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more lived in.
0001_American_Beauty_01.39.29.046-01.39.34.885 	The Colonel moves stiffly and seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented.
0001_American_Beauty_01.47.04.638-01.47.07.970 	She seems disconnected from what's happening.

0003_CASABLANCA_00.04.35.859-00.04.44.190 	The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display of concern.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.25.479-00.05.28.541 	When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.07.28.724-00.07.30.380 	His companion seems uninterested in his dilemma.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.32.06.815-00.32.10.566 	He seems even more scared now.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.39.30.991-00.39.33.421 	They seem to be transported by each other as Ilsa laughs.

0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.56.850-00.46.57.207 	Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.08.21.220-01.08.22.260 	He has only three chips left and seems bewildered.
0004_Charade_00.42.41.366-00.42.43.707 	As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit.
0005_Chinatown_00.09.03.825-00.09.06.155 	He seems to be concentrating on it.
0005_Chinatown_00.11.05.536-00.11.08.510 	Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading into the sea, whipping it into a foam.
0005_Chinatown_00.15.22.220-00.15.22.522 	Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them.
0005_Chinatown_01.32.42.797-01.32.44.089 	It seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them.
0006_Clerks_00.03.29.883-00.03.30.529 	The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers.

0011_Gandhi_02.02.35.867-02.02.38.984 	Walker stares at him, then at what Gandhi seems to be looking at.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.16.506-02.15.17.772 	He watches, looking tensely from one group to the other, almost terrified by what seems about to happen.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.40.073-02.15.41.786 	The air itself seems breathless with tension.
0011_Gandhi_02.42.25.327-02.42.27.188 	But apart from that, he is alone; the whole ashram seems deserted.
0011_Gandhi_02.46.22.727-02.46.24.824 	It seems a little island of calm in a sea of wild chaos.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.27.294-02.54.28.315 	There are thongs around their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even more powerful.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.49.909-02.55.57.662 	He is sobbing, but in his anger it seems almost as though he means to kill Gandhi in retaliation.

0020_Raising_Arizona_00.51.59.357-00.52.00.491 	His gesture seems to take in the trailer and the entire domestic situation.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.57.37.595-00.57.37.968 	As we come closer, eventually drawing in to a close shot of his face, we gradually realize something peculiar about his eyes: He seems to have none.
0021_Rear_Window_00.04.33.319-00.04.33.964 	Jeff seems a little disappointed.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.10.228-00.08.10.890 	His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.28.873-00.21.32.321 	He holds this attitude for just a moment, then seems to shake off his concern to lift his head and turn his attention to what might be happening in his neighborhood beyond his window.

0021_Rear_Window_01.44.49.708-01.44.52.388 	He seems a little puzzled by what he sees.
0021_Rear_Window_01.50.43.522-01.50.46.641 	Both in dress and manner she seems quite happy and adjusted to life.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_00.06.02.554-00.06.06.025 	He seems stunned to find himself holding the knife and drops it.

0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_00.31.57.176-00.32.11.386 	As Evan reads, the world seems to ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY VIBRATE around him LIKE A TUNING FORK.

0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_02.32.16.608-02.32.22.918 	he seems to fix each and everyone of his MEN with his eyes.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_02.43.31.932-02.43.35.886 	time seems to stand still as each regards the other.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.37.20.410-00.37.23.183 	The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.02.786-00.40.08.372 	At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.23.232-00.48.23.706 	He seems to fill the Heavens.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.23.706-00.48.24.778 	With his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.40.815-00.48.45.495 	Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.57.23.225-00.57.25.257 	It seems to be stuck.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.30.26.603-00.30.27.630 	His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it.

0030_The_Hustler_00.10.04.923-00.10.06.002 	He seems pleased.
0030_The_Hustler_00.20.23.745-00.20.26.865 	Big John looks around -- the shot seems impossible.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.25.538-00.38.30.284 	The attendant, whose every move seems to require a tremendous effort, shuffles over and grabs a towel as Eddie removes his jacket.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.29.328-00.23.30.243 	He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing--the Man In Black seems to be in control.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.51.434-00.27.53.992 	And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of FEZZIK's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.53.42.071-00.53.43.132 	BUTTERCUP, touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.17.39.968-01.17.42.165 	BUTTERCUP, and she couldn't seem more serene.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.19.09.471-01.19.12.354 	And it is a bit unnerving--a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.19.12.354-01.19.16.752 	and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.24.58.150-01.25.05.192 	She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.03.929-01.26.04.930 	Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.41.50.979-00.41.58.435 	The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to confront her.

0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.17.41.355-00.17.47.941 	Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.30.20.122-00.30.31.515 	The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, revealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, offcenter, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.31.55.693-00.32.00.384 	He surveys the Young Man who, at this moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.
