0011_Gandhi_00.07.12.684-00.07.23.186 	He's taken out the ticket but there is a bit of bluster in his attitude and it is cut off by a cold rebuff from the European.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.10.373-00.11.13.053 	Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, plainly frightened by the challenge, but just as plainly determined to take it.

0011_Gandhi_00.14.12.215-00.14.22.619 	Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes the box from Singh and moves to the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.22.835-00.14.30.695 	For a second, his eyes lock with the sergeant's -- and then nervously, he takes a card and drops it in the wire basket, and another.

0011_Gandhi_01.16.07.356-01.16.12.017 	A second, then Sir George takes the pen and signs angrily.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.10.362-01.19.27.239 	He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.40.541-01.19.42.176 	But for all his impact, they still take the measure of him with caution.
0011_Gandhi_01.21.55.368-01.21.58.550 	That takes the wind out of all of them.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.04.122-01.31.06.943 	Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut.

0011_Gandhi_02.26.12.185-02.26.17.301 	Bourke-White just absorbs it, staring at the palace, taking in the experience with the appetite of her breed, and her own particular sensitivity.
0011_Gandhi_02.29.39.760-02.29.47.157 	He pivots around, moving beside her, and slowly demonstrates the process, taking her hands, guiding her.
0011_Gandhi_02.32.07.266-02.32.10.043 	Finally Azad takes just a step forward.
0011_Gandhi_02.32.15.150-02.32.23.910 	She holds her hand out to him and he takes it.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.16.834-02.40.19.402 	They have all been taken by surprise by the offer -- and do not feel what Gandhi feels.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.22.599-02.48.29.951 	He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.49.764-02.48.51.968 	Gandhi must take his eyes from his writing to look, and he is almost moved to tears at the sight of Nehru.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.57.599-02.55.04.780 	Suddenly he moves violently toward Gandhi, taking a flat piece of Indian bread (chapati) from his trousers and tossing it forcefully on Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.30.328-02.56.46.586 	But he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to Gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of Hindu son to Hindu father.

0013_Halloween_00.22.16.580-00.22.21.988 	Then it takes off down the street and disappears around a corner.
