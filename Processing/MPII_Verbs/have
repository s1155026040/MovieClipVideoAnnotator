0001_American_Beauty_01.13.51.852-01.13.59.724 	Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.26.26.287-01.26.29.265 	Simon and Carol have thus declared their majority.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.37.51.192-01.37.52.476 	Melvin has no idea he has insulted her.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.44.16.217-01.44.19.685 	But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.10.59.827-02.11.01.028 	She stands on the precipice of being transported away from the logic which has been her lifeline.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.07.32.683-00.07.33.267 	She has a bracelet on her wrist.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.14.58.093-00.15.06.430 	Yvonne has never taken her eyes off Rick.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.22.16.499-00.22.17.796 	We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event.

0003_CASABLANCA_00.42.53.584-00.42.56.701 	His manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in Casablanca.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.08.21.220-01.08.22.260 	He has only three chips left and seems bewildered.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.09.18.659-01.09.21.511 	Meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.35.43.263-01.35.49.298 	He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up outside the hangar.
0004_Charade_00.04.37.432-00.04.38.547 	JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so lightly.

0004_Charade_00.49.25.235-00.49.27.500 	He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.
0004_Charade_00.49.29.908-00.49.30.545 	The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak.
0004_Charade_00.49.41.934-00.49.49.653 	Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe.
0004_Charade_00.50.02.466-00.50.04.741 	DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away.
0004_Charade_00.55.50.071-00.55.52.981 	He has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold him.
0004_Charade_01.04.55.297-01.04.57.123 	GIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter, removing it from the envelope and reading it.
0004_Charade_01.06.43.899-01.06.50.744 	REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone case.
0004_Charade_01.06.58.675-01.07.00.597 	TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON.
0004_Charade_01.10.08.873-01.10.13.838 	They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the Pont au Double.
0004_Charade_01.12.42.501-01.12.43.419 	He wheels as the door is slammed and REGGIE, who had been standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key.
0004_Charade_01.14.36.648-01.15.02.124 	CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her.
0004_Charade_01.19.25.398-01.19.27.301 	A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now begins sweeping the river banks.
0004_Charade_01.22.23.315-01.22.23.471 	Except that GIDEON has no strings to cut -- only a throat.
0004_Charade_01.27.07.402-01.27.14.522 	It has been torn in half and scotch-taped back together.
0004_Charade_01.30.00.431-01.30.00.823 	Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up.
0004_Charade_01.30.01.328-01.30.01.477 	They have collected quite a CROWD.
0004_Charade_01.39.01.514-01.39.02.461 	He has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway.
0004_Charade_01.45.26.815-01.45.43.187 	During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second.

0005_Chinatown_00.16.23.868-00.16.25.368 	In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart- shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken.
0005_Chinatown_00.20.22.905-00.20.31.728 	This time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come out of his office and up behind him.
0005_Chinatown_00.23.02.359-00.23.05.548 	Smaller than Mulwray's, he has most noticeably a lacquered marlin mounted on the wall.
0005_Chinatown_00.26.01.550-00.26.01.880 	The squeaking has obviously come from the chamois.

0005_Chinatown_01.31.15.222-01.31.16.475 	Here the windows have blinds.
0005_Chinatown_01.32.42.797-01.32.44.089 	It seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them.
0005_Chinatown_01.39.33.471-01.39.35.198 	Ice cream has melted around her.
0005_Chinatown_01.50.30.634-01.50.32.048 	The blow has forced tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself.

0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.12.14.062-00.12.14.916 	The tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street river town; a picturesque, mid-19th-century remnant of the old river civilization, which general progress has left behind.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.20.00.351-00.20.05.956 	Something new enters his eyes; a game has begun between them.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.24.04.943-00.24.11.724 	He desperately conceals his reaction; he thinks BEN has betrayed him.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.39.52.723-00.39.53.773 	He has heard the VOICE and starts to move out of CLOSE SHOT.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.39.53.873-00.39.55.743 	He has moved over to the coat on back of chair.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.49.24.806-00.49.25.821 	The dark interior of the car has swallowed him up.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.51.50.441-00.52.04.291 	While he is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, Phyllis has taken out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.28.674-00.53.29.309 	Neff has reached the top of the steps.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.54.29.181-00.54.35.656 	Neff has come out and hobbled to the railing.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.56.01.248-00.56.01.367 	Neff has fallen on the tracks.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.59.25.822-00.59.26.977 	Charlie, the attendant has washed Neff's car and is now polishing the glass and metal work.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.38.137-01.01.39.248 	Neff has put down his hat and briefcase.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.45.834-01.01.46.931 	Norton has gone behind his desk.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.47.046-01.01.48.282 	Keyes has come in, and Neff after him closes the door quietly.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.03.46.672-01.03.48.265 	The secretary has opened the door.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.04.04.585-01.04.05.233 	Norton has placed a chair.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.10.29.976-01.10.31.046 	He has stopped in front of Neff.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.05.591-01.12.05.775 	The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been standing close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.05.845-01.12.06.652 	The door has just started to open.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.17.33.650-01.17.35.514 	In the foreground, Neff and Lola are having dinner.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.22.33.339-01.22.34.582 	Keyes has opened the door for Jackson.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.48.045-01.32.48.672 	Neff has just come out of Keyes' office.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.50.539-01.32.51.792 	All the employees have now left.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.00.910-01.34.01.905 	The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.45.28.314-01.45.28.498 	Neff has reached the door.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.16.841-00.04.17.239 	The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.53.504-00.06.56.695 	The porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his point of view we can just glimpse the European talking with the conductor.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.57.492-00.06.58.610 	Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.25.433-00.11.28.046 	A wire basket has been placed on supports over the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.10.646-00.12.20.939 	It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.22.661-00.12.26.790 	This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the crowd, as though expecting a reaction.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.58.313-00.12.59.076 	At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.50.027-00.14.56.981 	Gandhi, on his hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he drops it defiantly in the basket.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.07.559-00.15.14.775 	The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.08.503-00.18.09.597 	They have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, run-down.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.46.100-00.18.47.168 	One youth has flicked his cigarette -- hard.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.09.601-00.20.12.731 	He has paused before an office and a young girl (Sonja) has come from it to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.18.611-00.21.19.777 	Smuts has risen.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.37.697-00.21.39.642 	This last remark has been directed toward Charlie Andrews, who sits near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.12.476-00.22.16.602 	But they have come by a site where a building is being erected, and a European (Kallenbach) is perched above a doorway on the half-completed structure, getting a level.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.57.334-00.22.58.160 	It has an awning spread before it.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.43.206-00.28.45.727 	This is the more sober Gandhi they have come to know.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.55.238-00.28.57.426 	He has their attention now.
0011_Gandhi_00.29.40.361-00.29.50.511 	And now he gets the response he has wanted.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.34.680-00.32.40.489 	As it pulls away, Tyeb Mohammed and Singh come up to Gandhi, both made wary by the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired.
0011_Gandhi_00.33.48.886-00.33.49.538 	He has a blunt farmer's face.
0011_Gandhi_00.35.00.422-00.35.02.108 	The car with the civilian has returned in the distance.
0011_Gandhi_00.35.36.123-00.35.39.274 	The clergyman who has given Charlie the use of his pulpit sits beneath it, embarrassed, but sticking resolutely to his decision to give Charlie a hearing.
0011_Gandhi_00.37.29.603-00.37.35.125 	The tall civil servant has been waiting for them.
0011_Gandhi_00.38.06.045-00.38.09.146 	We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk.
0011_Gandhi_00.38.41.355-00.38.44.452 	A wry smile, and he sits on the edge of the chair Smuts has directed him to.
0011_Gandhi_00.41.44.725-00.41.51.438 	The General has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.27.800-00.42.30.227 	He speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.47.856-00.42.52.841 	An Indian reporter has cornered Ba behind him.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.07.623-00.43.09.513 	He has guided Gandhi to the first step of the platform.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.47.774-00.43.49.280 	Nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.49.280-00.43.50.869 	He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack.
0011_Gandhi_00.45.42.948-00.45.44.465 	Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah, now he looks a little startled at Prakash.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.06.763-00.46.08.653 	He meets Prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.50.110-00.46.52.267 	Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently, penetratingly.
0011_Gandhi_00.51.16.434-00.51.21.819 	Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.36.178-00.54.38.106 	Ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.15.354-00.54.17.206 	As they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.52.05.847-00.52.07.055 	She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms.
0011_Gandhi_00.55.24.070-00.55.27.615 	The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.29.895-00.56.32.847 	Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.41.552-00.56.48.176 	He is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.45.722-00.56.46.291 	Patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.46.291-00.56.46.765 	But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.56.160-00.56.57.001 	This is the first time we have seen them.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.57.001-00.56.57.267 	He has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium.
0011_Gandhi_00.57.33.240-00.57.35.465 	Nehru has turned, having caught that last remark.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.01.463-00.59.04.790 	Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.45.993-00.59.47.443 	Nehru has half risen in his seat to address Charlie Andrews, who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has stopped dead at the sight of the car.
0011_Gandhi_01.00.41.345-01.00.42.786 	Gandhi has finished the last potato.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.06.655-01.01.07.672 	They have reached the trough.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.53.268-01.01.55.359 	He hasn't moved, and neither have his friends.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.22.159-01.02.22.786 	It is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.16.449-01.04.17.962 	He has stepped down from the train.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.01.397-01.05.04.379 	It has the cold assurance of a lawyer, and the Captain is a little shaken by it.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.26.986-01.05.29.027 	Already he has scored a victory -- and as he moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with flushed greetings.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.56.699-01.06.00.328 	And finally Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, the two women listening together but Meha's wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead and hardly combed, her sari dirty.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.44.391-01.07.46.391 	It contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but Ba.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.52.113-01.07.53.504 	The batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.58.871-01.08.00.624 	He has looked up.
0011_Gandhi_01.10.09.865-01.10.10.796 	Gandhi has remained seated, pensive.
0011_Gandhi_01.10.49.233-01.11.07.759 	He has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to Charlie.
0011_Gandhi_01.14.59.672-01.15.00.522 	But even so the Governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly.
0011_Gandhi_01.17.45.560-01.17.45.860 	All the others have been dressed in European clothes.
0011_Gandhi_01.18.59.373-01.19.00.815 	His stand has produced a little shock of surprise.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.44.084-01.19.44.928 	The idea has caught hold.
0011_Gandhi_01.23.24.659-01.23.25.952 	Gandhi has listened to it all with a growing sense of despair.
0011_Gandhi_01.27.23.225-01.27.24.936 	Only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.16.488-01.31.18.141 	We are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.18.141-01.31.21.620 	And finally the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left.
0011_Gandhi_01.36.08.432-01.36.10.076 	Chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, and he strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends.
0011_Gandhi_01.36.33.620-01.36.35.527 	He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.23.581-01.37.24.116 	We are still in the Council Room, but time has passed.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.24.116-01.37.24.796 	The Indian delegation has gone, and the British are relaxing as a servant pours.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.19.223-01.38.27.129 	But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_01.40.09.628-01.40.10.776 	This has sobered the audience somewhat.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.45.148-01.41.45.365 	The child's mother with two little ones hanging on her has followed him out.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.32.497-01.43.33.525 	It has a terrible sobriety.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.49.864-01.45.51.587 	Two police have a man on the ground.
0011_Gandhi_01.52.51.205-01.52.54.476 	During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.08.577-01.56.10.064 	He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.43.032-01.58.45.320 	Its style tells us some years have passed.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.34.257-02.04.36.927 	Irwin has listened; it's beginning to make a little sense.
0011_Gandhi_02.05.37.320-02.05.40.777 	Irwin has turned to him.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.53.940-02.12.54.132 	He struggles to his feet, facing the policeman who has struck him.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.23.840-02.15.24.998 	We see Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.34.897-02.14.35.118 	He has approached the chief police officer.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.16.202-02.24.20.449 	Gandhi winds up what he has done, and starts to rise.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.20.449-02.24.24.650 	Gandhi has moved toward the steps.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.26.098-02.26.30.880 	Bourke-White -- who has been moving, crouching to shoot him and the light -- sags back against the wall, relaxing at last.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.43.265-02.26.44.336 	She has a smile as penetrating and warming as his.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.51.780-02.26.55.061 	Bourke-White bursts into an appreciative radiance -- already she has assessed him, and been won.
0011_Gandhi_02.27.16.331-02.27.18.800 	She has Gandhi in the foreground, a soldier on the wall above and behind him.
0011_Gandhi_02.28.03.775-02.28.05.542 	The garden they are in has gone to seed a bit, but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.47.943-02.31.49.348 	Azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.36.279-02.36.37.178 	He turns to see that Mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as Gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.56.975-02.37.01.932 	We have pulled back and we see a whole gathering of Hindu youths near the entrance to the ashram.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.13.553-02.37.15.158 	Nehru has stepped out onto the porch and he glares at the youths.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.19.051-02.37.19.911 	It is his presence that has silenced them.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.00.795-02.38.02.112 	We have seen Azad and Pyarelal come out on the porch behind Nehru.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.36.756-02.38.38.669 	They are all awed, timid even in his actual presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.05.160-02.38.08.008 	As they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.23.558-02.39.26.909 	He has been looking at Gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.46.287-02.39.48.243 	And Jinnah has drawn himself up.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.16.834-02.40.19.402 	They have all been taken by surprise by the offer -- and do not feel what Gandhi feels.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.38.132-02.40.44.915 	Gandhi's eyes sag with the despair of a man whose last hope, whose faith, has crumbled around him.
0011_Gandhi_02.44.42.295-02.44.47.168 	Patel and Azad are there and Pyarelal of course, and with them now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the first time we have seen him among Gandhi's intimate group.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.26.131-02.45.32.007 	He has turned and seen Gandhi standing slowly.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.32.007-02.45.35.940 	It has almost stopped him.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.12.833-02.48.13.974 	Nehru lowers his head again; it is like another burden on a man who already has too many.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.36.061-02.48.37.931 	They are whispering quietly, but Mirabehn has stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting.
0011_Gandhi_02.49.32.370-02.49.36.019 	But Nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair.
0011_Gandhi_02.51.54.220-02.51.56.690 	The crowd has spread from him all along the street; they stand against the walls of the houses staring at him, terrified to move.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.18.724-02.55.20.114 	It is as though the man has told him of some terrible self- inflicted wound.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.02.634-02.56.06.972 	He raises his hand to the height Nahari has indicated as his son's.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.51.119-02.55.54.336 	Nahari has listened.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.02.583-03.00.04.418 	But Bourke-White has looked from Patel to Gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in Patel's words.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.30.110-03.00.34.753 	Abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.56.511-03.01.00.182 	He moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to Patel.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.08.857-03.01.09.254 	He has passed her, he's in the doorway.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.16.698-03.01.22.987 	He turns; the last words have betrayed the smile on his face; they have a painful sense of truth about them.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.11.04.064-00.11.11.155 	They each have a drink.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.15.21.274-00.15.22.712 	Harry lets his hand slide down over his belly, taking his time, wanting to show that he has it together now.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.09.57.185-01.09.58.981 	The Black Guy has his I.D.

0026_The_Big_Fish_00.12.19.428-00.12.23.601 	The latter has tears in his eyes.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.15.12.846-00.15.14.402 	The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.19.42.046-00.19.44.305 	He has a dozen encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.22.01.770-00.22.08.996 	A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.23.29.585-00.23.32.367 	The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair back.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.27.08.240-00.27.09.316 	The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.44.419-00.28.45.945 	The road has narrowed to a rough path.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.51.542-00.28.52.718 	For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.29.58.891-00.30.01.052 	One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.04.809-00.30.14.979 	At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.56.753-00.30.57.256 	Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.36.47.028-00.37.02.759 	Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.37.16.767-00.37.20.410 	Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.37.46.604-00.37.50.997 	Still, he's having a blast.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.26.122-00.40.30.889 	But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.41.08.599-00.41.09.835 	Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.47.07.535-00.47.11.408 	He may only be four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.54.821-00.49.04.996 	stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.57.30.184-00.57.32.291 	It has green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.57.36.191-00.57.37.444 	Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold on tight.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.58.59.037-00.59.06.088 	He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.00.03.213-01.00.04.910 	He has to get there as soon as possible.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.06.18.530-01.06.27.359 	He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has it for him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.08.43.786-01.08.58.630 	We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.20.41.632-01.20.45.614 	The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.25.04.980-01.25.05.449 	He has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot Norther.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.26.52.772-01.26.55.867 	Caught, Edward has to confess.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.29.04.745-01.29.08.744 	When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.36.13.379-01.36.17.056 	Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.56.12.647-01.56.26.616 	Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.03.18.025-00.03.20.487 	The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.07.52.690-00.07.52.943 	He has dark worried eyes and a goatee.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.10.16.618-00.10.19.850 	He wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.11.56.015-00.11.58.517 	Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER?
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.27.20.710-00.27.26.363 	Donny has been watching Quintana.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.30.10.254-00.30.25.655 	The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.36.28.068-00.36.28.444 	Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.48.47.900-00.48.51.879 	The limo has rolled to a stop.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.49.00.753-00.49.01.049 	Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the curb.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.54.13.824-00.54.18.539 	The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.56.32.741-00.56.34.030 	They have reached the Dude's car.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.56.34.203-00.56.36.429 	The driver's side exterior has been scraped raw.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.59.57.937-00.59.58.241 	He has a large Western-style mustache and wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.11.10.487-01.11.12.749 	Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.12.57.365-01.12.58.571 	A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.21.50.147-01.21.54.958 	She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.27.31.866-01.27.33.563 	Furniture has been overturned, upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.48.16.643-01.48.18.612 	The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing just to the side of and behind Walter.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.12.24.121-00.12.25.486 	Maguire has a newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.35.01.317-00.35.03.361 	Fergus has a gun in his hand.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.36.18.634-00.36.22.696 	He has a cut lip where Jude struck him.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.37.07.671-00.37.14.367 	Fergus gains on him--stretches his arm out--but Jody sprints ahead again--as if he has been playing with him.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.40.30.488-00.40.31.210 	He has the picture in his hand.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.43.22.348-00.43.24.415 	She has her face turned away, but sees him in the mirror.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.46.22.278-00.46.23.400 	From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.54.05.769-00.54.11.280 	She looks down toward where the car has pulled away.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.23.33.865-01.23.38.969 	When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks back.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.29.55.186-01.29.56.333 	She has a satchel in her hand.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.30.45.128-01.30.47.786 	Fergus opens what Jude has given him--looking inside.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.44.45.019-01.44.50.962 	Looks out the window to where he can see Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have gathered.
0029_The_Graduate_00.00.48.393-00.00.49.627 	Ben has not moved.
0029_The_Graduate_00.03.22.628-00.03.27.768 	Now the bed on which he is lying moves as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.
0029_The_Graduate_00.17.00.151-00.17.03.805 	Ben jumps up, gets the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
0029_The_Graduate_00.21.19.123-00.21.21.395 	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen.
0029_The_Graduate_00.21.24.474-00.21.26.886 	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience.
0029_The_Graduate_00.23.20.187-00.23.22.477 	He has a big smile.
0029_The_Graduate_00.27.30.217-00.27.32.823 	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.
0029_The_Graduate_00.27.41.555-00.27.43.760 	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been holding.
0029_The_Graduate_00.39.52.825-00.39.53.633 	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.
0029_The_Graduate_00.40.47.228-00.40.48.885 	In the dining room, Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking through the doorways toward Ben.
0029_The_Graduate_01.02.57.070-01.02.57.696 	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the slot on their right.
0030_The_Hustler_00.00.52.160-00.00.52.825 	It has a bar, a short order counter, a skee-ball machine, and pool tables for small, friendly games.
0030_The_Hustler_00.02.11.170-00.02.12.360 	Several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play.
0030_The_Hustler_00.15.50.042-00.15.53.902 	Eddie, hand to his mouth, realizes that the big moment has arrived and beckons to Charlie for his leather cue case.
0030_The_Hustler_00.37.39.935-00.37.43.283 	He has been up all night.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.56.199-00.38.57.200 	He now has on a clean shirt and is clean and freshly shaven.
0030_The_Hustler_00.39.44.332-00.39.45.142 	And a frank, open regard which has nothing in it to imply flirtation -- or the lack of it.
0030_The_Hustler_00.50.12.067-00.50.14.956 	From his pocket he pulls out the few crumpled bills he has left.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.28.999-01.09.31.795 	As the cards are dealt Eddie steals a glance at the man he has come to see.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.41.823-01.17.45.397 	Eddie has lost control of himself.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.49.068-01.17.51.340 	He is completely oblivious to the glowering faces of the group of men who have gathered around the table to watch.
0030_The_Hustler_01.23.46.500-01.23.47.611 	It is a warm, beautiful day, and Sarah has a basket with her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.23.47.611-01.23.50.868 	Eddie seems happy to be out with her, almost as if he has forgotten the casts on his hands.
0030_The_Hustler_01.27.35.831-01.27.40.595 	He knocks on the door with his wrist, as he would if he still had them on.
0030_The_Hustler_01.29.30.235-01.29.30.817 	Eddie and Sarah had walked past it the first day they met.
0030_The_Hustler_01.29.33.011-01.29.34.710 	She has on new dress and Eddie, looking a little ill at ease, has on a suit and tie.
0030_The_Hustler_01.32.34.729-01.32.37.807 	Eddie, having hurriedly paid the bill, follows after her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.35.591-01.43.36.539 	Sarah has been drinking.
0030_The_Hustler_01.48.14.758-01.48.15.770 	The dance couples strain to get a look at what has happened.
0030_The_Hustler_01.50.28.409-01.50.37.066 	Findley has a mischievous look on his face as he brings out a cloth bag and pours out the three billiard balls on the table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.53.30.589-01.53.35.779 	A game has just ended as Sarah quietly descends the stairs.
0030_The_Hustler_02.09.00.028-02.09.01.328 	He has a drink in his hand.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.02.48.884-00.02.53.849 	Don has crossed to the chest of drawers and fished out more shirts and socks.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.03.46.948-00.03.49.736 	From the living room has been coming the sound of Wick opening the closet door and ransacking.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.06.52.792-00.06.54.847 	Wick, who has been smoking a cigarette throughout the scene, throws it out the window.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.07.59.205-00.08.00.629 	Wick has twisted the string off the bottle.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.06.690-00.08.07.601 	Wick has stepped to the sink.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.16.893-00.08.19.636 	Don has something of the feeling of a man watching the execution of a very good friend, but he senses Helen's eyes upon him and preserves his nonchalant expression.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.50.458-00.08.55.805 	Wick turns toward Don, who has followed Helen to the entrance hall.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.12.01.514-00.12.06.516 	The salesman has taken two bottles from the rack in the foreground and put them on the counter.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.14.03.137-00.14.05.152 	Nat has come up with the bar towel to wipe off the wet ring left by the glass.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.17.57.739-00.17.58.144 	THE CAMERA is on the wet rings which the wet glass has left on the bar.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.27.03.545-00.27.08.474 	A man has entered the bar, a round-faced, middle-aged man with pince-nez.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.34.11.286-00.34.13.222 	The attendant has returned to the other end of the counter and resumed his doze.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.14.126-00.38.14.683 	It is dark and the rain has settled to a drizzle.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.29.126-00.38.29.989 	As we have left it, empty save for Nat and Don.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.40.57.494-00.41.01.404 	When he has reached the security of some potted palms, he looks back.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.42.11.204-00.42.15.054 	Helen has hung up too.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.43.23.782-00.43.28.270 	Wick has bent over Don and loosened his tie.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.43.40.988-00.43.44.963 	Paying no attention to the sound of steps which has been coming from the staircase, Wick rises, puts the glass of whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, short.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.45.02.306-00.45.04.208 	From under the couch has rolled the bottle.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.59.33.816-00.59.36.903 	He fishes what money he has left from his pocket.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.00.30.033-01.00.35.681 	Don has entered.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.18.879-01.14.22.914 	Don has risen.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.18.10.256-01.18.11.099 	The doctor must have been in another building, because over his shoulders is flung a dark blue overcoat.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.02.290-01.26.04.731 	The bat has made another swoop and spread its wings over the mouse.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.02.854-01.26.04.175 	Apparently the bat has seized the mouse in its claws.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.12.425-01.26.14.327 	She must have been listening from Don's first scream.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.28.07.149-01.28.08.410 	Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.44.938-01.30.47.528 	Don has already reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to Helen.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.31.58.765-01.32.00.103 	The pawn broker has put Helen's coat on a hanger and is brushing it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.32.41.768-01.32.42.352 	As he has been out in the rain, his hair is still a little damp.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.39.13.803-01.39.18.509 	Don has risen from the couch and has picked up the glass of whiskey.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.39.32.994-01.39.35.026 	Don has sunk back on the couch again.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.13.275-00.01.16.260 	He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid, pinches his cheek.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.09.13.059-00.09.18.140 	During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.12.01.548-00.12.11.182 	She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- --and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her-- --and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- --and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- --and the Eel slithers closer, closer-- --and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- --and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.00.913-00.16.02.505 	Once they might have been a fort, now the kind of resemble Stonehenge.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.23.196-00.17.23.868 	He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.18.37.134-00.18.41.057 	He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.11.314-00.23.17.489 	A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo--nothing can stop Inigo--and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.03.652-00.26.05.971 	He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.42.154-00.26.43.746 	The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.14.970-00.27.28.022 	FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one behind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.53.992-00.27.56.917 	Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and FEZZIK starts to slowly collapse.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.31.20.045-00.31.21.562 	As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.33.13.771-00.33.15.626 	VIZZINI, busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.42.050-00.38.43.062 	BUTTERCUP, staring transfixed at what she has wrought.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.43.40.090-00.43.48.857 	The two of them have by now crossed the pond.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.17.818-00.44.23.907 	Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way--it's Lightning Sand--a great patch of it, and it has her--a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.48.660-00.44.53.218 	It sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.58.325-00.45.05.166 	THE LIGHTNING SAND, as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.45.38.619-00.45.40.656 	She's still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.46.05.042-00.46.05.863 	The have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.50.15.410-00.50.17.852 	The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.57.49.627-00.57.52.244 	He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.06.10.993-01.06.11.595 	And there has never been such pain.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.07.14.267-01.07.16.568 	And FEZZIK crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.08.21.884-01.08.23.085 	He has failed.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.14.20.951-01.14.23.796 	During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.49.622-01.18.53.034 	He has an impediment that would stop a clock.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.40.833-01.21.47.637 	And as his Warriors attack-- Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that--but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit the floor.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.42.912-01.26.45.270 	Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home where the Count had gotten him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.27.24.456-01.27.25.470 	WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.
0033_Amadeus_00.02.20.330-00.02.21.281 	He has cut his throat but is still alive.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.08.201-00.17.13.068 	He is puzzled; Constanze has disappeared.
0033_Amadeus_00.22.27.370-00.22.28.257 	A group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment.
0033_Amadeus_00.35.22.980-00.35.26.120 	He nods - he has wanted this result all the time.
0033_Amadeus_01.13.21.831-01.13.22.043 	Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant, MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG.
0033_Amadeus_01.17.27.425-01.17.27.728 	A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages.
0033_Amadeus_01.54.10.174-01.54.12.489 	But he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him, searching for him and then finds him.
0033_Amadeus_02.21.46.545-02.21.48.711 	Constanze has come into the living room.
0033_Amadeus_02.34.42.290-02.34.51.441 	Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre.
0033_Amadeus_02.35.02.290-02.35.02.538 	He has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as the three attendants in The Magic Flute.
0033_Amadeus_02.43.31.872-02.43.33.917 	The carriage has arrived.
0038_Psycho_00.03.18.860-00.03.30.168 	Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him.
0038_Psycho_00.05.01.567-00.05.03.375 	She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in.
0038_Psycho_00.09.46.797-00.09.51.812 	Cassidy has gone into Lower's office.
0038_Psycho_00.10.03.292-00.10.07.649 	Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from Caroline.
0038_Psycho_00.16.07.067-00.16.12.651 	She glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents.
0038_Psycho_00.17.25.061-00.17.33.427 	The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off after her.
0038_Psycho_00.18.44.843-00.18.49.268 	She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
0038_Psycho_00.19.43.943-00.19.48.002 	She has seen the Patrolman.
0038_Psycho_00.19.49.106-00.19.50.978 	Mary has to force herself to look away.
0038_Psycho_00.26.04.878-00.26.07.000 	The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.
0038_Psycho_00.27.38.486-00.27.43.320 	Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get some attention.
0038_Psycho_00.28.13.632-00.28.18.373 	He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached it.
0038_Psycho_00.28.27.951-00.28.29.478 	Mary has placed her handbag on the counter.
0038_Psycho_00.29.34.551-00.29.36.172 	The rain has slowed down considerably.
0038_Psycho_00.32.53.544-00.32.56.588 	Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy.
0038_Psycho_00.35.30.166-00.35.33.459 	Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs.
0038_Psycho_01.05.17.470-01.05.22.040 	Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door.
0038_Psycho_01.07.33.681-01.07.35.877 	Arbogast has reached him, the picture extended.
0038_Psycho_01.25.04.822-01.25.07.875 	Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up.
0038_Psycho_01.27.58.928-01.28.00.771 	She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity fandango, takes the Sheriff's arm, starts away.
0038_Psycho_01.29.24.399-01.29.25.805 	Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.
0038_Psycho_01.29.51.504-01.29.57.571 	When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman.
0038_Psycho_01.38.10.613-01.38.12.548 	Sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.
0038_Psycho_01.41.16.864-01.41.18.804 	The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and flaky.
0038_Psycho_01.42.08.826-01.42.11.789 	A young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into the room.
0038_Psycho_01.47.36.635-01.47.38.087 	The room has a quality of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.12.23.325-00.12.25.535 	He has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.32.08.622-00.32.13.709 	Cole has become very still.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.52.46.103-00.52.48.218 	Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater from over her shoulder.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.54.27.306-00.54.28.323 	Cole has to pee.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_01.26.54.642-01.27.01.535 	Malcolm glances to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has ceased.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.03.29.250-00.03.30.576 	Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.16.04.063-00.16.07.130 	Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.16.22.118-00.16.26.179 	Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.19.18.083-00.19.21.116 	Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.19.46.045-00.19.46.527 	Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.19.46.527-00.19.47.705 	He has her ass in his hands.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.26.47.398-00.26.48.758 	The activity has died down.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.39.36.054-00.39.37.493 	Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.49.20.614-00.49.26.555 	Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual has happened at all.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.49.26.584-00.49.28.830 	They realize they have not been spotted.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.08.29.652-01.08.31.120 	Thelma has forgotten all about the money.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.14.28.555-01.14.37.055 	She is still looking at Thelma as if she has completely lost her mind.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.34.51.323-01.34.56.247 	Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.45.07.910-01.45.09.803 	She has her finger on the lever.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.56.56.711-01.57.04.487 	More police cars have joined, and from every direction, police cars are swarming across the desert, although none are in front of them.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_01.57.20.860-01.57.22.996 	Louise has tears streaming down her face as she realizes there is absolutely no escape.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.02.09.674-00.02.13.878 	Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.02.36.276-00.02.38.097 	Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.02.45.499-00.02.49.173 	She has just put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.21.49.981-00.21.59.402 	The screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's facade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.26.42.420-00.26.45.018 	Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.26.50.063-00.26.52.192 	Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.28.56.410-00.29.01.268 	The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.36.52.899-00.36.54.982 	Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has opened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star Dusty Frye.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.44.01.879-00.44.03.904 	Hannah, however, has her back turned.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.03.17.646-01.03.21.230 	A man has his arm around a woman.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.11.05.935-01.11.07.247 	The camera has reached the executives in the audience.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.24.04.379-01.24.10.968 	Norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful expression on her face.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.35.41.098-01.35.47.076 	Through the window, Holly and Mickey can be seen having lunch.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.12.36.631-00.12.40.552 	The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back) propel Indy across the deck toward the rail.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.19.43.552-00.19.44.885 	Indy, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.19.57.840-00.20.00.110 	Indy has to shake his head at Donovan's apparent lack of judgment.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.22.38.793-00.22.40.241 	We see the place has been ransacked.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.26.59.661-00.27.01.468 	They have arrived at the front steps of the library.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.27.32.931-00.27.36.157 	Brody glances at the Diary, then at the window -- noticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.28.16.944-00.28.17.417 	Indy has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.31.35.634-00.31.41.304 	Indy only has to give it a quick glance to know.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.37.49.348-00.37.51.719 	Indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.38.06.207-00.38.11.386 	Turning, Indy sees that Elsa has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.39.28.268-00.39.41.459 	By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.42.36.045-00.42.39.190 	His bedroom has been ransacked.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.48.23.870-00.48.25.021 	Henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.51.39.357-00.51.43.199 	Indy and Henry rush back into the room where Elsa had been left, only to find: A NAZI COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.52.52.526-00.52.54.808 	Indy and Henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.01.30.285-01.01.32.785 	All four Radiomen now have their guns drawn.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.02.24.059-01.02.31.535 	Indy grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.02.41.678-01.02.44.812 	A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.17.44.632-01.17.45.985 	Henry has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.19.05.028-01.19.07.270 	Indy has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.26.58.110-01.26.59.265 	Brody has been left alone in the tank.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.41.04.218-01.41.06.063 	We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.44.52.689-01.44.53.880 	He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.45.21.932-01.45.23.377 	Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.48.31.864-01.48.37.600 	Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.49.16.080-01.49.24.725 	He has his back turned to Indy.
0051_Men_in_black_00.09.00.014-00.09.02.696 	Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand.
0051_Men_in_black_00.10.11.853-00.10.14.874 	The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS, and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.
0051_Men_in_black_00.11.18.072-00.11.19.910 	The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the Guggenheim.
0051_Men_in_black_00.27.41.218-00.27.42.683 	Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest.
0051_Men_in_black_00.27.50.856-00.27.51.675 	Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it.
0051_Men_in_black_00.29.32.367-00.29.33.073 	As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner.
0051_Men_in_black_00.41.33.077-00.41.33.392 	The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown.
0051_Men_in_black_01.11.31.064-01.11.32.347 	Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman.
0051_Men_in_black_01.16.25.921-01.16.30.138 	There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds.
0051_Men_in_black_01.22.40.485-01.22.41.151 	Jay and Kay have only a second to react before -- The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.
0051_Men_in_black_01.23.07.886-01.23.12.779 	Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's face.
0051_Men_in_black_01.24.50.547-01.24.55.498 	Jay knows what he has to do.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.01.43.118-00.01.51.177 	Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.01.58.805-00.02.03.103 	It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.
