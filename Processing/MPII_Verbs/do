0001_American_Beauty_00.30.51.329-00.30.53.263 	He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.
0001_American_Beauty_00.32.28.900-00.32.30.406 	Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want.
0001_American_Beauty_00.50.24.795-00.50.26.167 	Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.
0001_American_Beauty_01.06.11.435-01.06.14.412 	Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.45.901-01.32.47.812 	He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.
0001_American_Beauty_01.33.06.884-01.33.12.269 	She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.
0001_American_Beauty_01.40.31.513-01.40.35.268 	and so does the Colonel.
0001_American_Beauty_01.47.23.075-01.47.26.519 	Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.28.109-00.21.28.366 	As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give him notice.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.29.06.275-01.29.09.285 	Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.45.30.031-01.45.35.037 	Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.22.394-00.46.30.496 	He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.10.28.419-01.10.29.667 	Pretending not to do so, Rick glances in Ilsa's direction.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.11.35.906-01.11.42.851 	Rick gets up, as does Laszlo.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.38.52.341-01.38.53.995 	He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa.
0004_Charade_00.20.16.651-00.20.18.661 	He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so.
0004_Charade_00.32.00.777-00.32.03.398 	REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else.
0004_Charade_00.49.41.934-00.49.49.653 	Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe.
0005_Chinatown_00.28.07.113-00.28.07.540 	She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office.
0005_Chinatown_00.45.41.120-00.45.45.329 	Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.07.32.367-00.07.35.501 	WILLA does a bewildered take, then looks again towards the cars o.s.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.17.11.847-00.17.18.976 	He fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; about to pour he does a take at BESS'S PHOTOGRAPH.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.19.56.910-00.19.57.499 	He does a little take.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.31.00.658-00.31.03.032 	WILLA, in the darkness, does not move.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.48.08.516-00.48.12.757 	Wondering what to do next.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.53.33.382-00.53.34.065 	JOHN is wondering what to do now.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.13.42.792-01.13.46.755 	Maybe we see -- though JOHN does not -- the thanksgiving in her eyes.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.31.59.426-00.32.03.095 	Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first bus ride to school years ago.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.30.28.514-00.30.29.460 	Neff still does not answer.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.15.706-01.13.17.946 	She moves toward him but he does not respond.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.14.945-01.18.15.297 	Neff recognizes him immediately but Jackson does not look up.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.49.891-01.40.50.708 	As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.50.943-01.40.51.273 	Only then is it apparent that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.21.517-01.42.22.085 	This time Zachetti allows him to do it.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.35.027-01.43.37.738 	Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.08.818-00.03.17.373 	We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.45.574-00.11.45.822 	She possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to do that which she would rather not.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.07.366-00.36.09.379 	though a few pointedly do not.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.17.575-01.07.19.884 	Shukla shares the howdah with him, but does not dare break Gandhi's black mood.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.18.432-01.13.20.105 	And so do the journalists.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.30.678-01.38.38.313 	There is applause and noise, but Ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, who is talking with Patel and Nehru.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.29.832-01.43.31.411 	But he does not go on.
0011_Gandhi_02.32.50.454-02.32.54.239 	Patel stands, letting Mirabehn pass before him and do down the corridor with Azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.33.26.162-02.33.29.369 	He pauses, nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.16.834-02.40.19.402 	They have all been taken by surprise by the offer -- and do not feel what Gandhi feels.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.51.083-02.48.52.464 	He does so with effort, and at last he sees Patel.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.54.377-02.55.58.681 	His face almost cracks -- it is a chink of light, but it does not illumine his darkness.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.30.58.333-00.31.01.359 	So does Bo Catlett for that matter.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.07.37.178-00.07.38.173 	A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.08.11.736-00.08.13.316 	George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.21.43.311-00.22.09.412 	We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.51.13.069-00.51.17.290 	Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.20.28.087-01.20.29.042 	He spreads the newspaper out in front of him, muttering as he does so.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.22.54.594-01.22.55.520 	He does so and closes the door.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.40.39.995-01.40.41.633 	Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or says.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.56.18.725-01.56.21.753 	As he does so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist, forcing him to let George go.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.38.05.723-00.38.08.397 	Pickers perform in the bed of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he pushes a broom.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.43.35.007-00.43.46.705 	Strangely, the three laundresses do not answer, though they do smile at him as they continue to sing.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.09.49.044-01.09.49.955 	As his hand chinks free, Pete does not react to his newfound liberty.
0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_01.35.10.329-01.35.10.722 	So too does the drooling hound.
0017_Pianist_00.12.53.195-00.12.56.228 	As she does so, the door of Henryk's room opens and he stands leaning in the doorway, watching, as if amused.
0017_Pianist_00.43.00.243-00.43.01.943 	A young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not seem to take in what he's saying.
0017_Pianist_00.56.11.687-00.56.17.594 	The moment they do so two Jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread.
0017_Pianist_01.00.31.236-01.00.37.926 	So does Szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below.
0017_Pianist_01.10.42.438-01.10.44.281 	Now, so do the others.
0017_Pianist_01.18.20.345-01.18.21.636 	While he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed.
0017_Pianist_01.24.04.138-01.24.05.854 	While he does so.
0017_Pianist_02.16.45.527-02.16.47.835 	So does the man.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.15.30.581-00.15.34.374 	Jules is the one who does the talking.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.25.37.777-00.25.38.962 	Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.42.55.893-00.42.58.329 	Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.39.015-00.52.40.311 	Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_00.52.46.893-00.52.56.424 	What do you know, she did it!
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.24.906-01.00.33.545 	Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.00.31.416-01.00.33.629 	Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_01.51.14.991-01.51.17.573 	Fabienne does climb on.
0019_Pulp_Fiction_02.09.14.047-02.09.16.153 	Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.47.58.893-00.47.59.303 	As he does so we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.57.37.968-00.57.38.188 	Although his eyes are unblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs, but only fire - either a reflection of the campfire or something roaring - burning-inside.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.58.31.850-00.58.32.252 	He still does not react to Nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.18.14.990-01.18.15.748 	Facing forward, they do not see Lenny approaching again through the rear window.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.24.37.416-01.24.39.407 	Hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.11.461-00.17.13.758 	She does a professional model's turn in the dress showing off its features.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.53.346-00.51.55.846 	She is doing her inevitable leg practice at the same time.
0021_Rear_Window_01.33.23.255-01.33.24.022 	Quickly Thorwald does pick it up.
0022_Reservoir_Dogs_00.58.40.019-00.58.52.999 	Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's BEGGING him not to do this.
0022_Reservoir_Dogs_01.11.49.937-01.11.51.438 	CAMERA does a 360 around the men.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_00.55.23.301-00.55.25.140 	Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.09.31.866-01.09.34.385 	Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.09.28.385-01.09.30.145 	Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.19.56.882-01.20.06.498 	Evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch!
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.20.35.501-01.20.37.609 	Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.41.09.490-01.41.13.611 	All Evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose.
0023_THE_BUTTERFLY_EFFECT_01.45.13.775-01.45.16.705 	He's still debating what to do when: ANDREA WALKS IN and is startled by the unexpected sight of Evan holding a huge knife.
0024_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_FELLOWSHIP_OF_THE_RING_00.55.18.115-00.55.26.373 	The four RINGWRAITHS fly done the empty streets, like horsemen of the apocalypse.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_00.27.15.762-00.27.17.450 	something about the BOY intrigues her -- but she does not know why.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_01.31.18.931-01.31.19.841 	The ORC CATAPULTS do not fire rocks.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.45.37.367-00.45.40.681 	Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.10.14.598-00.10.15.764 	So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_00.30.10.254-00.30.25.655 	The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.23.03.311-01.23.09.973 	The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.45.25.975-00.45.28.275 	She stands absolutely still as he does so.
0029_The_Graduate_00.58.33.040-00.58.35.540 	The car directly ahead of him does not move to the right.
0030_The_Hustler_00.16.44.148-00.16.51.941 	Charlie does the same, counting the bills out one by one.
0030_The_Hustler_00.20.03.847-00.20.06.311 	So Eddie does the same.
0030_The_Hustler_00.30.35.789-00.30.38.935 	So does Bert.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.45.397-01.17.49.068 	He is shooting as he did at Ames, rapping in his shots with perfect control.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.28.06.260-00.28.09.022 	Nat does break down and pours a drink.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.05.309-00.30.13.502 	It is doing a land-office business, checking dripping umbrellas and apparel.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.37.43.398-00.37.45.915 	She stops and looks down, as does Don.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.01.01.487-01.01.11.775 	After a time he brushes the tears from his eyes with his sleeve and as he does so, catches sight of something which rivets his attention, brings a half-crazed smile to his lips.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.25.23.591-01.25.28.622 	Just as he does so, from the direction of the window there whirs past him a strange winged thing.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.32.26.759-01.32.32.376 	On it lies a revolver and the second page of a letter on which Don is writing.But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear Wick: I did finish something, didn't I?
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.47.468-00.01.49.351 	He does his best to smile.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.06.45.090-00.06.51.148 	THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.10.02.600-00.10.05.730 	Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly--or do they?
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.15.42.863-00.15.59.859 	Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.04.501-00.23.04.884 	THE MAN IN BLACK, stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.41.374-00.28.45.583 	Because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.35.45.247-00.35.50.933 	Buttercup flinches, but does not retreat.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.37.02.886-00.37.06.898 	And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.41.54.338-00.41.57.810 	WESTLEY, instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.07.120-01.18.11.325 	Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.03.318-01.22.04.467 	Then he does a most unexpected thing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.10.934-01.25.11.297 	His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.39.137-01.25.46.790 	And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.23.041-01.26.24.173 	But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.29.18.069-01.29.21.208 	HUMPERDINCK, doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him.
0033_Amadeus_00.22.21.427-00.22.24.847 	Mozart does it with a furious grace, then leaves the room.
0033_Amadeus_00.39.49.802-00.39.56.565 	Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest.
0033_Amadeus_01.02.13.086-01.02.15.387 	The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them.
0033_Amadeus_01.46.15.720-01.46.16.472 	We do look at them.
0033_Amadeus_02.42.46.522-02.42.49.126 	We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits writing assiduously.
0038_Psycho_00.19.01.850-00.19.12.421 	Mary, engrossed in the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see the Patrolman.
0038_Psycho_01.25.07.575-01.25.14.335 	Suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade.
0043_Thelma_and_Luise_00.28.41.237-00.28.45.619 	Louise did not realize she was doing it.
