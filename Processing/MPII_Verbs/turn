0001_American_Beauty_00.08.44.916-00.08.49.609 	Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish.
0001_American_Beauty_00.10.00.454-00.10.00.989 	Lester turns off the faucet,

0001_American_Beauty_00.22.25.811-00.22.26.748 	Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing.
0001_American_Beauty_00.23.57.690-00.23.58.522 	Startled, Barbara turns to him.
0001_American_Beauty_00.31.52.492-00.31.55.662 	Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room.
0001_American_Beauty_00.32.28.900-00.32.30.406 	Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want.
0001_American_Beauty_00.56.44.746-00.56.46.429 	Lester turns down the volume on the stereo.
0001_American_Beauty_01.00.11.712-01.00.17.302 	Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly.

0001_American_Beauty_01.14.29.662-01.14.34.218 	The Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail.
0001_American_Beauty_01.14.40.872-01.14.41.542 	We turn into the Burnham driveway.
0001_American_Beauty_01.17.38.655-01.17.44.730 	Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry.
0001_American_Beauty_01.22.45.551-01.22.47.318 	He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes BLUE.
0001_American_Beauty_01.35.10.831-01.35.16.219 	Ricky grabs his backpack, turns and walks out the door, leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing heavily.
0001_American_Beauty_01.38.27.607-01.38.36.561 	Jane turns to Ricky and he takes her in his arms.
0001_American_Beauty_01.41.34.546-01.42.02.655 	The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night.
0001_American_Beauty_01.48.51.401-01.49.01.855 	She turns her head to look out the window: The RED DOOR of the Burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain.
0001_American_Beauty_01.49.24.425-01.49.27.601 	He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.00.43.459-00.00.43.636 	And now she turns and faces the hallway.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.08.44.601-00.08.45.818 	Simon turns serious.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.19.33.595-00.19.35.210 	And he turns and sees the naked model.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.26.560-00.21.27.112 	Leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.30.16.932-00.30.18.675 	He turns toward her.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.49.45.061-00.49.46.717 	He turns for.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.01.27.813-01.01.29.880 	Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's rapt.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.32.12.353-01.32.14.488 	She turns to him.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.44.16.217-01.44.19.685 	But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.46.04.000-01.46.14.125 	We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.47.11.164-01.47.19.308 	he takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.05.40.712-02.05.43.350 	turning as the sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.05.55.756-02.05.57.619 	He half turns to leave.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.13.13.475-02.13.14.187 	Suddenly the lights of the bakery turn on as it opens for business.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.02.22.466-00.02.42.605 	A POLICE OFFICER takes a piece of paper from the typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.54.017-00.05.54.872 	But Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again to Renault.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.24.11.950-00.24.14.536 	Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns to a certain page.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.25.31.401-00.25.32.092 	She is so beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.55.18.862-00.55.20.426 	Signor Ferrari turns around.

0003_CASABLANCA_01.17.31.685-01.17.33.925 	Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.21.21.312-01.21.30.658 	He turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.22.27.870-01.22.29.574 	She turns and walks away from him.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.07.690-01.26.11.878 	He opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.32.02.825-01.32.04.310 	He walks to the door, then stops and turns around.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.33.57.045-01.33.59.474 	All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking towards them from the bottom of the stairs.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.34.08.331-01.34.10.651 	They turn towards Rick, bewildered.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.34.13.734-01.34.14.418 	He smiles as he turns toward Rick.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.36.10.377-01.36.13.898 	Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and hands them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.36.14.402-01.36.15.419 	Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.38.43.234-01.38.45.463 	They all turn to see the plane readying for take-off.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.04.439-01.40.04.858 	Strasser turns to see the plane taxiing towards the runway.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.35.388-01.40.38.888 	In the distance the plane turns onto the runway.
0004_Charade_00.10.09.580-00.10.10.211 	GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT.
0004_Charade_00.17.18.647-00.17.20.473 	He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit.
0004_Charade_00.17.26.162-00.17.31.660 	He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to sit somewhere else.

0004_Charade_00.35.05.076-00.35.06.153 	REGGIE, moving quickly, turns and flies out.
0004_Charade_00.36.05.120-00.36.07.716 	He then turns back.
0004_Charade_00.41.06.146-00.41.07.842 	REGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face.
0004_Charade_00.48.52.975-00.48.59.713 	DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place.
0004_Charade_00.49.17.579-00.49.18.354 	He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work.
0004_Charade_00.49.27.729-00.49.29.654 	REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.
0004_Charade_00.49.40.550-00.49.41.779 	He turns back in REGGIE's direction.
0004_Charade_00.49.41.934-00.49.49.653 	Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe.
0004_Charade_00.54.26.985-00.54.27.324 	DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street.
0004_Charade_00.57.26.421-00.57.30.133 	DYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs.
0004_Charade_01.02.09.286-01.02.11.876 	She covers the phone and turns to DYLE in alarm.
0004_Charade_01.06.05.039-01.06.11.915 	She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS.
0004_Charade_01.07.49.371-01.07.50.197 	DYLE turns the key which is still in the door.
0004_Charade_01.08.07.130-01.08.10.411 	DYLE's hand appears and turns off the water.
0004_Charade_01.14.30.694-01.14.33.114 	She turns and leaves, slamming the door after her.

0004_Charade_01.30.37.587-01.30.38.782 	He turns to rush off and bumps smack into ADAM.

0004_Charade_01.46.10.306-01.46.12.428 	Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door, turns and fires at her.
0004_Charade_01.47.01.605-01.47.07.041 	CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery, hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.
0005_Chinatown_00.06.55.791-00.06.57.212 	He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods.
0005_Chinatown_00.07.06.524-00.07.09.910 	The man turns the overleaf on the map.
0005_Chinatown_00.12.00.988-00.12.03.838 	Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash light.
0005_Chinatown_00.20.36.171-00.20.41.674 	Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons and complaint.
0005_Chinatown_00.31.36.890-00.31.39.717 	One of the men turns and sees Gittes.
0005_Chinatown_00.31.41.091-00.31.43.567 	At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns around.
0005_Chinatown_00.40.11.991-00.40.15.131 	He turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel.
0005_Chinatown_00.40.17.219-00.40.20.699 	Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the spotlight.
0005_Chinatown_00.43.37.392-00.43.39.252 	Gittes turns slowly to Walsh.

0005_Chinatown_01.19.33.802-01.19.40.958 	With his jacket covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.
0005_Chinatown_01.40.35.606-01.40.41.240 	Gittes enters and turns on the light.
0005_Chinatown_01.40.49.202-01.40.50.720 	Gittes turns around.

0006_Clerks_00.32.48.970-00.32.51.263 	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was even heard.

0008_Fargo_00.26.08.711-00.26.12.865 	Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs.
0008_Fargo_00.31.35.107-00.31.35.355 	The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn the car.
0008_Fargo_01.32.22.187-01.32.24.395 	This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.05.37.204-00.05.44.574 	The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded sheet over his head.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.09.35.266-00.09.40.824 	The principal, embarrassed, turns and walks away.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.19.58.519-00.19.59.946 	Forrest and Jenny turn around.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.20.05.898-00.20.06.353 	Jenny turns and looks at Forrest.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.22.09.190-00.22.10.000 	Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.35.39.530-00.35.51.791 	Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.38.27.180-00.38.36.345 	Jenny turns and looks over the bridge.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.39.08.232-00.39.10.485 	Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.51.09.579-00.51.16.673 	Forrest turns around, then runs back into the jungle.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.51.30.434-00.51.36.681 	Forrest turns and looks, then rushes over.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.52.17.030-00.52.18.191 	Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground and turns him over.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.58.38.313-00.58.42.184 	Forrest turns the TV off and he is hit on the back of the head by a ping-pong ball.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.02.33.196-01.02.37.880 	Forrest turns and look at the NURSE.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.09.52.345-01.09.52.909 	Forrest turns and walks out the room.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.12.55.732-01.12.59.498 	Jenny turns and walks up to Wesley.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.13.17.206-01.13.18.375 	Forrest turns and looks.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.17.39.713-01.17.43.964 	He wheels himself over to television and turns it off.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.30.50.279-01.31.00.196 	She slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from the edge.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.43.37.532-01.43.52.609 	He turns and walks into the house.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.48.38.892-01.48.40.305 	Jenny turns off the TV and walks outside.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.49.25.718-01.49.30.063 	Forrest turns and walks toward the door.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.49.36.614-01.49.41.203 	Jenny turns and walks up the stairs.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.52.44.909-01.52.50.970 	Forrest runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and runs down the highway.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.57.59.636-01.58.05.069 	Forrest turns and look.
0009_Forrest_Gump_02.00.40.034-02.00.49.143 	Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages.
0009_Forrest_Gump_02.02.46.387-02.02.49.772 	Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room.
0009_Forrest_Gump_02.12.53.837-02.12.59.298 	Forrest turns and watches.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.08.38.162-00.08.40.094 	She turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.09.28.860-00.09.33.641 	He turns and looks through the arch.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.09.57.285-00.10.06.579 	She turns away from the mirror and sits in a big chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly visible.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.15.01.401-00.15.04.600 	Keyes takes his cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame of a lighted match.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.15.04.843-00.15.07.321 	He turns to Neff.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.22.54.861-00.23.11.314 	He turns away impatiently, paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws the club on the couch, paces again.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.38.27.996-00.38.30.070 	He turns around and looks towards the car.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.45.11.772-00.45.13.810 	He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who is now standing at the window.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.47.09.287-00.47.16.164 	He watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.51.27.888-00.51.32.313 	Phyllis drives on and never turns her head.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.52.977-00.53.54.804 	Phyllis turns and walks out of the shot in the direction of the parked car.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.54.00.992-00.54.02.059 	Neff is half turned away from the porter.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.55.40.695-00.55.42.022 	Neff turns slowly and watches Jackson go back through the car.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.56.24.949-00.56.25.897 	She turns to go.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.27.505-00.58.29.883 	Neff turns back to her.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.00.01.774-01.00.02.781 	He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the CAMERA again.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.03.38.087-01.03.38.252 	He turns back to Keyes and Neff.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.03.56.705-01.03.57.811 	He turns a little towards Keyes.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.06.37.704-01.06.40.653 	She turns and walks out.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.08.14.198-01.08.17.009 	With the doorknob in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.35.695-01.12.37.313 	He pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one last glance of annoyance.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.16.43.701-01.16.50.130 	She turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.55.568-01.32.59.474 	He turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.04.372-01.34.06.010 	The lights are turned on.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.47.123-01.40.49.653 	He looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.41.28.222-01.41.41.666 	Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.15.806-01.43.21.968 	As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.45.31.153-01.45.32.700 	He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.56.261-00.02.58.882 	Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.38.228-00.03.40.290 	He is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu half obscures him.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.56.695-00.06.57.492 	He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work.
0011_Gandhi_00.08.00.845-00.08.02.592 	He turns and walks out of the compartment.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.43.730-00.12.52.533 	And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.34.839-00.13.36.075 	Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather lamely.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.58.252-00.13.59.991 	The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.04.414-00.14.11.453 	He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.31.568-00.14.32.486 	Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.07.559-00.15.14.775 	The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.17.12.262-00.17.14.277 	He turns and waves to the parlor window.
0011_Gandhi_00.17.14.820-00.17.16.995 	And Gandhi turns back, and starts down the long, hilly street.
0011_Gandhi_00.19.41.971-00.19.43.746 	Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.12.731-00.20.13.477 	And now he turns to Sonja.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.31.789-00.22.33.474 	Gandhi turns to him, light-hearted again.
0011_Gandhi_00.23.09.950-00.23.11.643 	She turns back and walks into the building by the rear entrance.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.40.489-00.32.42.352 	Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly, then turns and signals the miners on.
0011_Gandhi_00.33.52.477-00.33.54.927 	The sense of the idea seizes Gandhi, and as the sound of the galloping horses nears, he turns and shouts too.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.21.976-00.34.23.752 	He turns to see: The sergeant thrown off his horse.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.34.680-00.34.39.561 	He turns his horse angrily and gallops back toward the factories.
0011_Gandhi_00.35.03.816-00.35.07.015 	The sergeant wheels by the car with the civilian; his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.26.417-00.36.27.835 	When he turns and reacts to the sight of Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.56.329-00.43.57.333 	He finally turns to Patel.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.46.291-00.56.46.765 	But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.01.463-00.59.04.790 	Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.34.682-01.03.36.599 	The captain turns briskly to two of his detail.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.43.214-01.03.46.833 	He turns his head slowly, his mouth agape at His point of view.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.19.041-01.05.21.709 	He looks around, then turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.57.520-01.07.58.871 	The wicket keeper makes a rude, facetious gesture, but as the batsman turns to settle in his crease again.
0011_Gandhi_01.09.45.509-01.09.50.769 	Charlie turns to the guard.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.34.556-01.13.39.339 	Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.57.309-01.13.58.434 	As he smiles down at them, he is turned by.
0011_Gandhi_01.16.01.117-01.16.03.428 	The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him.
0011_Gandhi_01.18.32.324-01.18.32.672 	Holding his tea, he turns to Gandhi with a little smile.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.10.362-01.19.27.239 	He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him.
0011_Gandhi_01.21.31.588-01.21.32.856 	Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.27.129-01.38.30.678 	It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.50.009-01.41.52.141 	They turn back to the train and just as they do, the tall Indian woman in the red sari tips a porter, taking one small bag from him and turns: Mirabehn (Madeleine Slade) is tall, quite pretty and extremely English despite the sari.
0011_Gandhi_01.44.02.022-01.44.05.175 	Then he turns to Mirabehn, made more aware of her by Azad's reference.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.17.697-01.45.20.339 	Some of the marchers turn at the shout.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.42.626-01.47.45.731 	They turn to him -- a sense of surprise, but they don't really believe he means the statement.
0011_Gandhi_01.48.27.291-01.48.30.350 	Jinnah turns away in anger.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.48.724-01.50.58.067 	When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.56.496-01.51.11.107 	She turns back, and propping up his head, helps him to sip.
0011_Gandhi_01.52.51.205-01.52.54.476 	During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion.
0011_Gandhi_01.52.56.498-01.52.58.479 	She starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again, then she turns suddenly, her attention caught.
0011_Gandhi_01.54.07.591-01.54.08.290 	He turns with a bright smile.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.30.481-01.55.32.568 	Gandhi turns to Mirabehn.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.58.473-01.56.00.831 	The clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.03.464-01.56.04.545 	The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.17.475-01.57.18.760 	The Advocate General smiles with a brittle disdain, then he turns to the judge.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.57.012-01.58.59.078 	He is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.38.067-02.01.38.897 	Gandhi turns to them.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.42.264-02.01.44.624 	He becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and he turns to see Walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.03.625-02.03.08.589 	He looks out to sea, and we intercut his face with Walker's, the sea, and the town itself as the sun turns it white.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.47.845-02.03.49.927 	Walker turns back to Gandhi, puzzled.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.55.596-02.03.58.236 	He turns from the sea to Walker, his eyes confident, elated, then he continues on down the promontory.
0011_Gandhi_02.05.37.320-02.05.40.777 	Irwin has turned to him.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.02.902-02.07.04.309 	He turns back toward his bungalow.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.08.297-02.07.10.392 	Gandhi holds their gaze a second, then turns and starts forward.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.52.538-02.08.53.710 	Gandhi smiles and turns back.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.23.728-02.11.26.878 	Finally, Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets, but answers the implied questions.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.21.344-02.14.23.846 	As he turns to leave Irwin speaks -- almost offhandedly.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.27.468-02.15.29.843 	Walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the Salt Works entrance.
0011_Gandhi_02.16.10.194-02.16.25.524 	He turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and the waiting lathis of the police.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.01.006-02.34.02.177 	The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.36.279-02.36.37.178 	He turns to see that Mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as Gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.08.925-02.40.12.351 	He measures Gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere, and when he is satisfied with that, he turns slowly to Nehru, Patel and Azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.26.131-02.45.32.007 	He has turned and seen Gandhi standing slowly.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.49.702-02.48.51.083 	Gandhi turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand.
0011_Gandhi_02.50.04.377-02.50.08.345 	Nehru turns back -- this time no confidence, only concern.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.20.998-02.56.30.116 	His face stiffens, he swallows, fighting any show of emotion; then he turns to go.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.30.328-02.56.46.586 	But he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to Gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of Hindu son to Hindu father.
0011_Gandhi_02.57.41.744-02.57.47.413 	Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her eyes.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.56.511-03.01.00.182 	He moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to Patel.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.28.158-03.01.29.876 	She turns to Mirabehn.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.31.662-03.01.33.452 	Bourke-White stares at her, then turns to look out at him.
0011_Gandhi_03.02.22.639-03.02.25.191 	Gandhi turns to the person; he makes the pranam.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.00.33.076-00.00.36.226 	Chili turns and studies Tommy a moment.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.01.31.610-00.01.44.919 	He merely watches in the glass as Tommy turns up his collar and steps out into the cold Miami day.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.09.13.922-00.09.17.598 	Chili exchanges a look with Tommy, watches as 'Mr Bones' goes down the hall into the back office, then turns to the black guy.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.13.02.095-00.13.06.000 	He turns and stares at the minivan.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.17.49.351-00.17.50.327 	Chili turns aronud and sees her standing in the doorway now, her arms folded across that chest, the Lakers T-shirt coming down just past her crotch.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.20.14.505-00.20.16.246 	Harry then turns back to Chili.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.20.35.947-00.20.38.830 	Harry turns to him.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.21.42.777-00.21.43.281 	She just looks at him, turns and walks out.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.40.16.419-00.40.18.455 	Chili stops, turns around.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.45.13.200-00.45.16.105 	Chili turns to a GUY a few seats away from him.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.22.44.298-01.22.46.812 	Doris winks at one of the young med students as the resident then turns to her, Karen, Chili.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.27.04.551-01.27.07.517 	Harry turns back to Chili and Karen.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.28.29.649-01.28.31.602 	Martin turns to him.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.41.14.580-00.41.16.931 	As a girl passes, he turns and watches her for a moment.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_00.42.41.849-00.42.45.334 	But after a few steps he turns around and starts back.

0016_O_Brother_Where_Art_Thou_00.49.26.623-00.49.30.945 	Sensing something, he looks up, cocks his head, and then slowly turns to look back.

0017_Pianist_01.33.15.038-01.33.18.786 	Dorota, partially turned away from him, plays Bach on the cello.
0017_Pianist_01.44.55.233-01.45.01.120 	When he turns back to look towards the T-junction, he sees a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poking out from a window in the next-door building but on the floor below.

0020_Raising_Arizona_00.05.31.523-00.05.37.940 	He wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts his eyes.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.07.22.289-00.07.22.456 	As the sun sets, the light is turning from yellow to amber.

0020_Raising_Arizona_00.23.41.711-00.23.46.507 	As Ed turns back to the bedroom.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.26.54.770-00.26.57.555 	Ed finally turns to face him.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.27.16.669-00.27.19.700 	Hi turns to face her.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.29.02.358-00.29.03.391 	She is turning to us, hands pressed to her ears, mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek and we are rushing into an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and her wildly vibrating epiglottis and we.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.35.56.403-00.35.59.198 	Glen at the top of the stoop, turns out to the yard.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.44.46.950-00.44.47.665 	He turns to the Cashier.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.45.40.182-00.45.42.089 	He turns and reaches to pick up the box but - PING-PING - bullets chew up the road near his hand.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.48.32.888-00.48.40.172 	He turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run.
0020_Raising_Arizona_00.51.29.106-00.51.32.672 	Finally Evelle turns to Hi.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.20.04.293-01.20.05.477 	Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as - the knife is thrown.

0020_Raising_Arizona_01.24.24.517-01.24.28.896 	He turns around with a thought.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.25.13.524-01.25.15.193 	Hi turns to face him.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.27.02.633-01.27.10.570 	He clears his throat and turns to the door.
0021_Rear_Window_00.05.10.789-00.05.12.699 	The girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player.
0021_Rear_Window_00.06.57.322-00.06.59.252 	He shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room.
0021_Rear_Window_00.07.40.058-00.07.41.500 	Jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.24.921-00.14.27.050 	His eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.27.640-00.14.31.132 	Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.34.232-00.15.36.127 	He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her.
0021_Rear_Window_00.16.55.289-00.16.56.675 	She turns on the second lamp and the light shows us that her beauty is not alone in her face.
0021_Rear_Window_00.16.57.626-00.17.00.641 	The CAMERA PANS HER over to a third lamp which she turns on.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.57.735-00.18.01.064 	She turns to look at him, and moves toward him, carrying the cigarette box.
0021_Rear_Window_00.18.20.334-00.18.23.537 	She turns around quickly and dashes to the door, dropping the cigarette box on the table as she passes, THE CAMERA PANNING with her.
0021_Rear_Window_00.18.22.537-00.18.24.072 	She goes up the two steps, stops, turns back to Jeff.
0021_Rear_Window_00.18.30.250-00.18.32.375 	She reaches for the doorknob, turns it.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.28.873-00.21.32.321 	He holds this attitude for just a moment, then seems to shake off his concern to lift his head and turn his attention to what might be happening in his neighborhood beyond his window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.21.753-00.24.25.491 	She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.13.861-00.26.16.260 	He turns his eyes in the direction of the composer's apartment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.28.16.870-00.28.18.370 	Lisa turns on her side, and stares into the room, angrily.
0021_Rear_Window_00.28.42.993-00.28.43.476 	She turns at last, and looks across at him.
0021_Rear_Window_00.30.58.313-00.31.00.147 	Lisa turns in the half-opened door.
0021_Rear_Window_00.38.28.659-00.38.29.159 	Jeff turns his head away for a moment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.02.422-00.39.04.922 	He quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.50.494-00.39.53.335 	The dog turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed, moves away.
0021_Rear_Window_00.40.16.897-00.40.18.077 	She turns around.
0021_Rear_Window_00.41.08.088-00.41.10.088 	He turns and again glances out of the window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.42.45.386-00.42.47.386 	Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room.
0021_Rear_Window_00.45.37.973-00.45.44.621 	Lisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little then she turns to the divan, apparently not too interested in his observation about the salesman's life.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.10.736-00.46.12.736 	She turns back to him with a blank stare.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.58.05.630-00.58.11.901 	And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.59.52.401-00.59.54.450 	THE PRINCE AND YELLIN, turning to her in the doorway.

0038_Psycho_00.18.44.843-00.18.49.268 	She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
0038_Psycho_00.33.05.541-00.33.11.171 	She turns her face away now, gazes sadly at the little empty room.
0038_Psycho_00.33.21.615-00.33.38.637 	Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.
0038_Psycho_00.44.19.859-00.44.25.015 	Norman turns his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen.
0038_Psycho_00.44.52.139-00.44.54.055 	He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window.
0038_Psycho_00.46.49.903-00.47.04.651 	Then she drops her robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.
0038_Psycho_00.47.31.917-00.47.34.937 	Mary's back is turned to the curtain.
0038_Psycho_01.01.41.805-01.01.44.970 	Sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls.

0038_Psycho_01.12.07.578-01.12.13.732 	As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch.
0038_Psycho_01.19.12.489-01.19.21.501 	Norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.54.58.309-00.55.01.293 	He turns and looks at Lee in surprise.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.56.02.622-00.56.07.613 	Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.56.34.443-00.56.39.014 	Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.16.12.857-01.16.15.361 	Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps.
