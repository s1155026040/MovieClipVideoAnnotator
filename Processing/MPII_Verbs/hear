0001_American_Beauty_00.41.19.489-00.41.20.699 	Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door.
0001_American_Beauty_01.29.36.091-01.29.38.861 	We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.13.403-01.32.16.667 	Then we HEAR a CAR APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird.
0001_American_Beauty_01.35.32.306-01.35.36.385 	She's obviously heard his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes, searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.
0001_American_Beauty_01.51.26.059-01.51.33.972 	and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.06.09.635-00.06.12.588 	He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.06.32.767-00.06.33.455 	As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step back.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.16.05.736-00.16.07.723 	she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.04.09.865-01.04.11.827 	Finally Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side of the door.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.04.18.370-01.04.22.753 	As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her breasts and gasps.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.32.45.059-01.32.57.516 	As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she sits down to wait -- through.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.57.47.167-01.57.47.309 	A beat then we hear Simon's whispered voice.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.06.14.370-02.06.15.932 	that Beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part.

0004_Charade_00.16.51.794-00.16.53.428 	The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in.
0004_Charade_00.31.12.641-00.31.15.108 	She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice.
0004_Charade_00.35.28.672-00.35.39.001 	When she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room.
0004_Charade_00.42.30.469-00.42.40.887 	He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks.
0004_Charade_01.07.59.634-01.08.02.383 	The sound of running water can be heard coming from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under the door.
0004_Charade_01.46.53.984-01.46.54.626 	ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage over his head -- and hearing them now.
0004_Charade_01.47.01.605-01.47.07.041 	CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery, hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.
0004_Charade_01.49.47.765-01.49.50.852 	At the same time we hear a shot.
0005_Chinatown_00.33.31.757-00.33.34.935 	Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them.

0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.33.17.251-00.33.19.725 	Then we hear a snipping sound o.s.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.39.52.723-00.39.53.773 	He has heard the VOICE and starts to move out of CLOSE SHOT.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.53.38.893-00.53.39.466 	Before they disappear, we hear PREACHER'S fists hammering against the door.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.53.39.650-00.53.45.391 	We stay on the house at leisure; we hear him lunging, shoulder to door; we begin to hear squeaking of hinges and splintering of wood.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.08.47.974-01.08.52.524 	RACHEL'S head bobs up and down above the bush; we hear the unmistakable sound of a female hand on a child's bottom.
0008_Fargo_00.25.37.312-00.25.39.207 	As we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.21.51.578-01.21.53.260 	Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff and, during the ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low voice on the phone in background.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.41.05.390-01.41.10.402 	He takes a few steps down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.13.416-00.04.17.138 	We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.50.976-00.16.55.822 	The ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter at they go down the hall.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.26.739-00.34.28.108 	Mounting, he is enraged to hear laughter.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.12.432-00.43.17.902 	There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we hear the military band from across the way as the troops prepare to march off.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.46.291-00.56.46.765 	But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility.
0011_Gandhi_01.12.30.031-01.12.32.759 	The courtroom is silent, but we can still hear the sound of the chanting outside.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.03.096-02.11.05.106 	and the shot becomes black and white, and we hear the music of Movietone News.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.21.061-02.26.23.944 	He is spinning in a shaft of light -- and looking off -- as we hear a camera click and the rustle of movement.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.19.175-02.34.21.589 	For a moment we hold it in silence and then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder.

0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.30.12.083-01.30.20.033 	But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear a click on the phone.
0014_Ist_das_Leben_nicht_schoen_01.39.31.695-01.39.38.445 	The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below.
