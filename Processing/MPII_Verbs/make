0011_Gandhi_01.04.41.325-01.04.42.766 	As their clothes indicate, the area is Muslim, so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to Gandhi as he moves through them.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.33.665-01.04.38.285 	And suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on the concrete platform, and the English captain shoves his way through to confront Gandhi down the little aisle that was being made for him.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.04.379-01.05.07.361 	He glances at Charlie who stands behind Gandhi now, and it makes him all the more uncertain.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.07.361-01.05.12.199 	He tries to make it severe, but it is a comedown.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.26.986-01.05.29.027 	Already he has scored a victory -- and as he moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with flushed greetings.

0011_Gandhi_01.38.27.129-01.38.30.678 	It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.41.672-01.38.47.924 	In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.45.647-01.41.46.108 	He makes a little salaam to her and moves through the confusion of the platform toward the camera.

0011_Gandhi_02.31.44.121-02.31.47.943 	Azad and Patel come to the doorway, Patel makes the pranam toward Ba and holds it as he obviously prays.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.47.943-02.31.49.348 	Azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her.
0011_Gandhi_02.35.24.773-02.35.27.368 	He grins in his youthful, beguiling manner and makes the pranam to the cheering crowd.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.27.294-02.54.28.315 	There are thongs around their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even more powerful.
0011_Gandhi_03.02.22.639-03.02.25.191 	Gandhi turns to the person; he makes the pranam.
0011_Gandhi_03.02.25.191-03.02.33.493 	Godse is making the pranam to him and he suddenly, wildly draws his gun and fires.

0012_Get_Shorty_01.07.41.038-01.07.48.261 	Chili glances about, makes sure no one's around, then pulls the key for the 'right' locker out from a crack in the pavement, near the stairwell.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.12.34.800-01.12.55.553 	Chili looks at him, the guy's either dumb or making conversation.

0013_Halloween_01.05.45.266-01.05.46.960 	He makes a guttural sound deep in his throat as the shape's hand closes tightly around his windpipe.
0013_Halloween_01.10.25.805-01.10.27.500 	Finally he makes up his mind and starts moving down the street, almost running, looking back and fourth at the rows of houses on either side for something out of place.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.46.287-00.26.50.596 	There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.39.137-01.25.46.790 	And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.05.900-01.26.07.785 	COUNT RUGEN, stepping back for just a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and.

0038_Psycho_00.45.43.915-00.45.52.893 	He by- passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen.
0038_Psycho_01.07.07.458-01.07.12.923 	He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as happy as it is making him.
