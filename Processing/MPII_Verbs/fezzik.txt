0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.19.538-00.14.20.188 	all three are strapped to fezzik like papooses.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.14.970-00.27.28.022 	fezzik considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the man in black slips down to avoid the charge, fezzik moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the man in black jumps for fezzik's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have fezzik's throat, locked across fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.08.051-00.28.15.719 	fezzik, as the man in black turns him over, puts his ear to fezzik's heart.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.07.14.267-01.07.16.568 	and fezzik crunches the albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.20.18.795-01.20.19.913 	and fezzik rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is indeed closing quickly.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.20.41.768-01.20.44.738 	and he whips it out, hands it to fezzik.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.09.687-01.21.14.988 	actually fezzik is dragging westley, who is, in turn, dragging yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash--westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.07.658-01.22.10.569 	inigo, momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving westley and fezzik to exchange curious looks and rugen, running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it and locking it just as inigo throws himself against it.
