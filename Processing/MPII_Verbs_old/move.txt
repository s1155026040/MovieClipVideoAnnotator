0001_American_Beauty_00.21.35.720-00.21.37.302 	We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where the moving van was parked earlier.
0001_American_Beauty_00.27.08.701-00.27.10.440 	The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela.
0001_American_Beauty_00.36.46.516-00.36.48.570 	As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder.
0001_American_Beauty_01.23.52.129-01.23.53.676 	He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete.
0001_American_Beauty_01.30.29.709-01.30.39.864 	Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth.
0001_American_Beauty_01.39.29.046-01.39.34.885 	The Colonel moves stiffly and seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented.
0001_American_Beauty_01.40.04.673-01.40.11.382 	The Colonel moves closer towards him.
0001_American_Beauty_01.43.03.632-01.43.06.302 	AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case.
0001_American_Beauty_01.46.22.812-01.46.48.785 	He pulls her jeans off and gently brushes his fingers over her legs, then moves up and caresses her face.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.11.20.427-00.11.22.526 	She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.19.39.094-00.19.42.555 	Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.42.13.752-00.42.14.365 	CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table -- Unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils and arranges them.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.52.32.924-00.52.35.722 	The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk on opening day of the hunting season.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.29.06.275-01.29.09.285 	Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.40.50.695-01.40.53.574 	She stumbles a bit -- flattered, momentarily moved and his for the taking.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.41.51.270-01.41.56.079 	Carol moves to the chair next to him.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.42.11.488-01.42.12.393 	 Her face moving toward him as he is wide-eyed and afraid.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.42.16.286-01.42.21.371 	But now his head moves back and he receives her kiss.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.47.59.642-01.48.16.363 	Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly but deliberately she lowers the towel.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.04.20.982-02.04.22.339 	He moves for the door.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.13.26.743-02.13.30.500 	As they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to clean the entranceway.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.18.07.675-00.18.09.251 	Rick moves out of the shadows and into view.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.22.16.499-00.22.17.796 	We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.33.30.252-00.33.31.089 	Sam prepares to move the piano away.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.47.41.061-00.47.43.807 	The train starts to move just as he boards.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.21.59.822-01.22.03.324 	He moves closer to her.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.25.41.448-01.25.43.598 	The lights move past them.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.35.43.263-01.35.49.298 	He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up outside the hangar.
0004_Charade_00.09.49.010-00.09.51.806 	Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head.
0004_Charade_00.10.03.309-00.10.03.881 	GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT.
0004_Charade_00.10.11.069-00.10.17.105 	CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall.
0004_Charade_00.35.05.076-00.35.06.153 	REGGIE, moving quickly, turns and flies out.
0004_Charade_00.49.25.235-00.49.27.500 	He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.
0004_Charade_01.15.39.237-01.15.41.942 	The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze with lights.
0004_Charade_01.21.53.421-01.21.56.094 	Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts moving down again.
0004_Charade_01.38.18.251-01.38.18.401 	The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors.
0004_Charade_01.45.26.815-01.45.43.187 	During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second.
0004_Charade_01.46.30.644-01.46.32.583 	ADAM appears, moving cautiously, gun ready.
0004_Charade_01.46.45.435-01.46.47.043 	As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for REGGIE.
0004_Charade_01.46.47.952-01.46.52.873 	As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board and throws on all the switches.
0004_Charade_01.49.47.115-01.49.47.619 	CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through out of sight.
0005_Chinatown_00.10.19.669-00.10.35.125 	Gittes hesitates, then moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in order to be above Mulwray.
0005_Chinatown_00.21.07.303-00.21.08.432 	Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does.
0005_Chinatown_00.24.02.296-00.24.05.115 	Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury.
0005_Chinatown_00.33.31.757-00.33.34.935 	Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them.
0005_Chinatown_00.33.34.935-00.33.42.457 	Escobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door.
0005_Chinatown_00.36.41.856-00.36.49.399 	They begin to walk slowly, again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the Coroner cubicles.
0005_Chinatown_00.37.26.641-00.37.28.989 	As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing.
0005_Chinatown_00.43.06.404-00.43.10.378 	Duffy sits staring at nothing, Walsh moves uneasily around the room.
0005_Chinatown_00.53.46.659-00.53.52.168 	He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door.
0005_Chinatown_00.57.09.562-00.57.12.648 	Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her.
0005_Chinatown_01.29.16.266-01.29.17.985 	Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door.
0005_Chinatown_01.31.14.975-01.31.19.848 	He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn.
0005_Chinatown_01.39.10.951-01.39.14.514 	Gittes moves toward it.
0005_Chinatown_01.39.33.924-01.39.35.792 	Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth.
0005_Chinatown_01.41.25.631-01.41.27.845 	The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him.
0005_Chinatown_01.58.28.983-01.58.31.186 	Escobar is getting out of his car, moving towards the duplex.
0005_Chinatown_02.03.23.986-02.03.27.319 	Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.04.22.964-00.04.24.417 	We MOVE IN fast to a HEAD CLOSE-UP.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.06.11.996-00.06.17.325 	He moves forward and OUT and in his place we see two police cars, small in distance, coming fast.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.06.19.195-00.06.20.226 	They move at high speed, with sirens.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.12.52.323-00.12.52.638 	A watch with a moving sweep-hand, ticking.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.14.51.524-00.14.55.523 	He moves, and as his shadow moves away we see the shadow of PREACHER, motionless.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.18.19.722-00.18.20.661 	WILLA looks both moved and pleased.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.24.29.207-00.24.29.482 	JOHN moves to stand in front of him; PEARL, to stand beside PREACHER, with the DOLL.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.27.34.069-00.27.36.276 	It stands vibrating, then moves out of shot with receding engine sound o.s., disclosing: ICEY'S skirts in BACKGROUND.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.28.53.085-00.28.59.443 	Startled, then again tender, she moves to:She adjusts the shade, looking always towards the bed.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.39.52.723-00.39.53.773 	He has heard the VOICE and starts to move out of CLOSE SHOT.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.39.53.873-00.39.55.743 	He has moved over to the coat on back of chair.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.39.59.293-00.40.02.518 	He moves toward the bed.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.41.14.504-00.41.16.431 	WALT moves towards kitchen cabinet.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.44.47.935-00.44.49.438 	We start moving before he does.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_00.47.43.467-00.47.49.949 	We PAN with PREACHER and ICEY as they move towards the door.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.07.36.063-01.07.37.042 	They move across the meadow like a nursery frieze.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.17.20.717-01.17.32.549 	He tethers his horse and, as we PAN and TRACK on behind him, walks to the bottom of the steps; RUBY moves into side of SHOT: beyond PREACHER, RACHEL stands behind her screen door, hands folded under apron.
0007_DIE_NACHT_DES_JAEGERS_01.18.44.645-01.18.47.179 	As they move in, RACHEL replies.
0008_Fargo_00.19.23.107-00.19.23.621 	The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.
0008_Fargo_00.44.03.301-00.44.07.346 	Grimsrud moves to retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his shoulder.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.32.08.759-00.32.11.632 	Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit down.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.33.43.016-00.33.45.351 	The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.59.01.733-00.59.08.019 	He holds the ball up and moves it back and forth.
0009_Forrest_Gump_01.41.56.917-01.42.01.089 	Forrest rides a lawn tractor as he moves the football field lawn.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.03.26.879-00.03.27.460 	One is dry-mopping the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, etc.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.08.55.618-00.09.04.323 	He looks around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered position on top.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.24.38.351-00.24.40.596 	Phyllis has moved over to the window.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.26.22.518-00.26.23.923 	They move back toward the living room.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.31.51.351-00.31.58.379 	He moves across the window and opens it wide.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.35.45.068-00.35.46.572 	Phyllis and Neff move close to the door.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.39.48.957-00.39.49.582 	Customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.41.21.161-00.41.21.588 	She moves away with her coffee and her child.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.41.22.858-00.41.25.961 	He moves closer to Phyllis again.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.00.094-00.53.00.455 	The passengers move forward to the tracks.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.14.819-00.53.16.633 	The conductor and porter see Neff on his crutches and move to help him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.55.42.213-00.55.46.107 	Then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.00.977-00.58.06.868 	The car, with the headlights out, backs up, swings around and moves off along the dirt road the way it came.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.14.110-00.58.16.546 	Their lips are seen moving but what they say is not heard.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.28.543-01.01.29.141 	They move on.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.06.902-01.12.07.283 	Phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.15.706-01.13.17.946 	She moves toward him but he does not respond.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.24.10.011-01.24.14.542 	Neff is moving slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.24.26.505-01.24.28.838 	Phyllis moves close to him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.24.42.643-01.24.44.774 	They move apart.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.29.41.079-01.29.41.352 	Neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves towards him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.30.31.883-01.30.38.744 	Neff moves back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.54.477-01.32.55.476 	He moves as if to go out, then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of a sudden idea.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.17.997-01.34.25.255 	She moves towards the living room, where there is still light on.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.41.10.737-01.41.13.561 	He moves behind the palm tree near the walk.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.20.808-01.42.21.417 	Neff moves again to put the nickel into Zachetti's pocket.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.30.676-01.42.32.685 	Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.33.236-01.43.34.868 	Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.45.21.317-01.45.27.676 	Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.56.261-00.02.58.882 	Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.04.840-00.03.06.994 	Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.17.373-00.03.21.650 	The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.40.290-00.03.41.400 	Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face -- then he moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.45.775-00.03.47.266 	Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice, thrice.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.59.387-00.04.04.368 	Soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half- step, step of the requiem march.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.21.819-00.18.22.031 	He starts to move forward.
0011_Gandhi_00.25.05.530-00.25.07.097 	She moves and kneels before him.
0011_Gandhi_00.26.24.964-00.26.26.659 	Gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand for silence.
0011_Gandhi_00.33.33.608-00.33.34.460 	Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed as they move forward, fear suddenly making their pace more labored.
0011_Gandhi_00.37.24.869-00.37.25.371 	The prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who Gandhi is.
0011_Gandhi_00.37.46.715-00.37.50.208 	The tall civil servant, moving with aloof distaste for his assignment, walks ahead of Gandhi, who in turn is followed by one of the prison guards, toward a grand staircase that is at right angles to them (i.e.
0011_Gandhi_00.37.56.005-00.37.56.881 	People working in offices pause to stare at Gandhi as he moves along, more uncomfortably aware of his prison garb than ever.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.05.135-00.42.06.619 	He glances at him and the well-dressed Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.23.520-00.42.27.800 	Gandhi is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the questions of an Indian journalist.
0011_Gandhi_00.55.24.070-00.55.27.615 	The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.00.796-00.56.01.976 	At last he moves back to his place on the platform.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.27.097-01.04.30.995 	Gandhi moves through the silent crowd, his hands in the pranam, bowing a little to either side.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.41.325-01.04.42.766 	As their clothes indicate, the area is Muslim, so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to Gandhi as he moves through them.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.26.986-01.05.29.027 	Already he has scored a victory -- and as he moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with flushed greetings.
0011_Gandhi_01.18.56.628-01.18.59.373 	He moves to a servant who stands, holding a large tray with a silver service of tea.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.28.434-01.25.30.116 	General Dyer, his armored car, his sepoys, moving toward the gate.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.25.108-01.41.27.435 	As people start to jump off the train he moves forward.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.32.424-01.41.33.798 	As he moves through the crowded platform.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.45.647-01.41.46.108 	He makes a little salaam to her and moves through the confusion of the platform toward the camera.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.03.520-01.55.11.629 	He looks at Gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to Gandhi's side.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.03.464-01.56.04.545 	The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.08.577-01.56.10.064 	He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly.
0011_Gandhi_02.00.17.546-02.00.20.825 	Showing the two of them before the altar of the temple, moving closer to each other.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.33.470-01.26.34.693 	But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward.
