0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.54.477-01.32.55.476 	He moves as if to go out, then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of a sudden idea.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.37.11.743-01.37.15.149 	He goes quietly over to the window and shuts it and draws the curtain.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.39.26.671-01.39.35.021 	Neff goes on until he is close to her.

0011_Gandhi_00.33.51.586-00.33.54.895 	And the miners begin to go down, some face up, shielding their faces with their hands, some burying their faces in the earth and covering their heads with their hands.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.30.069-00.34.30.691 	They begin to go down again and the sergeant wheels his horse and rides at Gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.30.762-00.34.31.829 	With deliberate, almost fatalistic pace, Gandhi goes first to his knees and then sprawls down flat, his hands over the top of his head, awaiting the blow of the horse's hoof.

0011_Gandhi_01.06.25.266-01.06.26.597 	He cannot go on.
0011_Gandhi_01.23.23.949-01.23.24.659 	Gandhi sighs, and their faces and minds go to more somber matters.
0011_Gandhi_01.26.00.142-01.26.00.697 	It won't go through the gates, one fender scraping against the gate post.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.29.832-01.43.31.411 	But he does not go on.

0011_Gandhi_02.07.23.370-02.07.24.984 	A thinner crowd here, but going all along the path.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.08.610-02.11.12.600 	And with that we get the Movietone Music tag and as the film fades, the lights go up on.
0011_Gandhi_02.28.03.775-02.28.05.542 	The garden they are in has gone to seed a bit, but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful.

0011_Gandhi_02.33.29.369-02.33.35.330 	Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba and crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.50.905-02.37.54.239 	He taps her again -- gently -- and goes out.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.46.812-02.48.47.763 	Bourke-White stares at him and Patel for a second and then her hand goes slowly, almost reflexively, for her camera.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.30.328-02.56.46.586 	But he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to Gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of Hindu son to Hindu father.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.18.380-00.38.22.881 	He joins her, takes the umbrella out of her hand and holds it over them both as they go down the street.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.30.230-00.38.31.915 	Nat is now taking the chairs from the tables and arranging the bar for the afternoon and evening trade, while Don leans back against the bar, the jigger of whiskey in his hand, and goes on talking.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.00.15.864-01.00.31.233 	Don drags himself up the last few steps, unlocks the door and goes in, leaving paper, bottle and note untouched.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.02.27.502-01.02.37.944 	He seems to be going straight to the ringing telephone, only he isn't.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.03.00.312-01.03.03.353 	Don goes to the glass, holds the two bottles upside down over it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.03.17.952-01.03.22.887 	Quickly he goes through his pockets.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.07.22.368-01.07.26.727 	THE CAMERA goes slowly up to a sidewalk clock with a diadem of three balls, which stands outside the hock shop.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.07.53.281-01.08.00.078 	He goes to the end of the bar closest the door, hoists the typewriter on it with a final awful effort, leans his head on it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.38.037-01.14.41.462 	He goes around the bend of the ell and there is the door, a heavy wooden one with a grated peep-hole and beside it a uniformed guard.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.39.962-01.14.43.587 	Don goes to the door, tries to open it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.25.01.434-01.25.09.386 	In the wall above the couch, close to the door, there is a hole in the plaster, as if left by a large nail carelessly withdrawn so that some of the plaster went with it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.02.631-01.26.04.054 	Beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle is going on.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.31.04.319-01.31.12.164 	Don disregards her, tries to go on.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.31.47.119-01.31.48.669 	He goes on.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.37.42.542-01.37.46.383 	Don goes to the door and opens it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.38.59.774-01.39.11.614 	Helen goes into the kitchen, puts the gun away, runs water into the percolator.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.13.275-00.01.16.260 	He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid, pinches his cheek.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.06.45.090-00.06.51.148 	THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.09.13.059-00.09.18.140 	During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.05.364-00.11.05.746 	And suddenly it's all gone ominous.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.15.549-00.14.16.392 	The rope goes all the way to the top.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.50.917-00.14.52.429 	He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.09.648-00.16.11.780 	THE ROPE, slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.07.198-00.17.08.280 	FEZZIK, who goes to Inigo.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.24.661-00.17.28.580 	Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.48.829-00.22.54.873 	The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.11.314-00.23.17.489 	A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo--nothing can stop Inigo--and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.51.434-00.27.53.992 	And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of FEZZIK's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.03.993-00.28.06.414 	FEZZIK goes to earth and lies still.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.39.543-00.38.40.161 	Down goes the Man In Black.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.42.45.337-00.42.49.252 	Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking without missing a beat.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.17.818-00.44.23.907 	Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way--it's Lightning Sand--a great patch of it, and it has her--a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.46.08.324-00.46.17.339 	He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he encouragingly goes on talking.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.50.24.321-00.50.25.102 	Westley starts to fall--the screen goes black.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.53.39.701-00.53.42.576 	THE CROWD, suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent KNEELING PEOPLE.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.00.06.477-01.00.08.050 	A lot of hollering is going on.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.11.48.769-01.11.52.426 	He goes to get a huge bellows.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.40.833-01.21.47.637 	And as his Warriors attack-- Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that--but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit the floor.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.59.407-01.26.01.599 	THE COUNT, stepping back, going for the heart again.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.18.649-01.26.23.041 	COUNT RUGEN, suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.29.42.730-01.29.50.521 	His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand.

0033_Amadeus_00.35.48.553-00.35.52.272 	Then he goes to the forte-piano and seats himself.
0033_Amadeus_00.56.28.820-00.56.32.749 	Salieri goes into the salon.

0033_Amadeus_01.33.07.272-01.33.17.782 	Salieri crosses and goes in alone.
0033_Amadeus_01.43.30.539-01.43.31.710 	He goes on tearing the pages determinedly.
0033_Amadeus_01.45.37.015-01.45.38.163 	Everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while.
0033_Amadeus_01.46.55.036-01.47.02.255 	Orsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach.
0033_Amadeus_02.16.18.197-02.16.29.867 	Now a little scared herself, Constanze goes to he front door and opens it cautiously.
0033_Amadeus_02.16.49.618-02.16.51.110 	He sees he manuscript on the table, and goes to it eagerly.
0033_Amadeus_02.22.19.632-02.22.24.689 	He turns and goes down the stairs.
0033_Amadeus_02.34.42.290-02.34.51.441 	Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre.
0033_Amadeus_02.46.54.273-02.47.02.105 	Forgetting Salieri, she goes to her husband.
0038_Psycho_00.04.24.380-00.04.32.622 	She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror.

0038_Psycho_00.09.57.351-00.10.04.492 	When the men are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle, smiles at it.
0038_Psycho_00.10.07.649-00.10.21.514 	When the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, starts to open door as.
0038_Psycho_00.18.44.843-00.18.49.268 	She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
0038_Psycho_00.20.02.225-00.20.15.655 	With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she goes to a close car, looks at it.
