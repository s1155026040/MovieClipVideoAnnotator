0021_Rear_Window_00.51.37.702-00.51.40.702 	we are now aware that the salesman is now in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, because the smoke from a newly lighted cigar is starting to ascend toward the ceiling of his room.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.59.530-00.52.02.530 	jeff smiles affectionately, and starts to turn his eyes away; but something startles him, and he looks quickly back.
0021_Rear_Window_00.55.29.371-00.55.30.861 	he starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him.

0030_The_Hustler_01.36.21.593-01.36.25.234 	sarah eyes bert distrustfully and starts to get in the cab.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.11.587-01.43.18.543 	screams are heard as the horses jerk out of the starting gate to begin their runs.
0030_The_Hustler_01.48.11.420-01.48.13.286 	then she starts to cry and starts to fall, but bert holds her up by the shoulders.

0030_The_Hustler_02.05.06.106-02.05.10.349 	eddie starts to screw his cue together.
0030_The_Hustler_02.12.40.902-02.12.43.996 	bert's men start to move forward but he stops them with a gesture of his hand.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.11.22.613-00.11.24.553 	she closes the door, takes the key and starts down the stairs.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.12.42.843-00.12.46.332 	he wants to start down the street but about twenty-five feet away stand two middle-aged hokinson ladies, one of them kerbing her dog on a leash.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.13.35.879-00.13.39.415 	he puts it down and starts playing the nonchalant, casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.13.669-00.30.17.988 	his eyes linger on its pocket with a certain tenderness, then he turns and starts towards the door of the auditorium.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.35.06.711-00.35.12.308 	don takes the coat, feels it hurriedly to make sure the bottle is still there, and starts away.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.35.15.926-00.35.21.264 	don comes back, takes the hat, starts away again.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.42.18.750-00.42.24.524 	as she joins them she evidently starts to explain.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.45.01.561-00.45.04.600 	as he is starting towards the door, the bottle rolls from under the couch.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.54.00.229-00.54.04.629 	he jumps up, runs back to the bookcase, starts pulling out books, row by row.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.57.47.185-00.57.49.083 	don starts to rise.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.59.59.912-01.00.10.273 	don turns, straightens himself as best he can and starts for home, shame weighing down every limb.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.04.15.727-01.04.21.837 	don steps over them carefully, closes the door and starts down the stairs.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.05.17.291-01.05.21.492 	he starts for it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.07.16.512-01.07.22.368 	he picks up the typewriter, turns and starts walking back.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.09.18.293-01.09.23.205 	don emerges, starts dragging himself up the street towards home.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.11.30.758-01.11.37.961 	he bends, picks up the typewriter and starts downstairs.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.24.13.113-01.24.20.001 	he takes the new bottle from his pocket and, sinking into the big chair, starts opening it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.24.19.388-01.24.20.013 	on the desk behind him, the telephone starts ringing.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.27.22.948-01.27.39.788 	with a desperate effort he flings himself to the floor and starts inching his way to the door.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.27.272-01.30.31.816 	he picks up the leopard coat and starts towards the entrance door.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.38.57.556-01.39.00.561 	she starts into the kitchen.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.40.05.888-01.40.12.787 	only this time in reverse: we start with don standing on that sunny day in the bedroom, packing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.06.41.216-00.06.45.181 	she descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.48.973-00.07.50.104 	as she starts to fall.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.08.08.261-00.08.09.072 	they start for the boat.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.14.175-00.11.15.906 	buttercup, diving into the water, starting to swim away.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.12.01.548-00.12.11.182 	she's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- --and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her-- --and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- --and buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- --and the eel slithers closer, closer-- --and buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- --and now the eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.20.188-00.14.22.691 	and he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.37.894-00.14.42.164 	the man in black, leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.24.661-00.17.28.580 	finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.21.56.863-00.22.04.542 	and what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on), and right from the beginning it looks different.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.25.51.216-00.25.55.861 	satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend--a rock flies into frame, shattering on a boulder inches in front of him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.53.992-00.27.56.917 	again fezzik slams the man in black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and fezzik starts to slowly collapse.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.33.20.254-00.33.23.189 	vizzini starts to laugh.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.33.37.619-00.33.38.258 	as they both start to drink, vizzini hesitates a moment.
