0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.36.113-01.26.39.245 	from outside comes the sound of footsteps racing upstairs toward his door, then the door- bell: short, short, long short.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.28.17.129-01.28.18.626 	a shaft of light comes from the corridor.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.30.144-01.30.33.383 	just as he is slipping out, comes.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.11.699-00.11.12.068 	it's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.19.06.873-00.19.11.358 	rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily, and as the cliff top at last comes within reach.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.14.656-00.22.18.755 	their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes so fast it's almost continual.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.48.829-00.22.54.873 	the two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.29.328-00.23.30.243 	he tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing--the man in black seems to be in control.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.56.917-00.27.57.719 	and there isn't much breath coming.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.42.707-00.29.44.999 	the man in black comes running around the path, sees vizzini, slows.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.50.969-00.29.51.995 	the man in black nods and comes nearer.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.34.55.542-00.35.01.451 	the man in black comes running into view, still dragging buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her along.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.40.736-00.38.41.914 	she stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.48.660-00.44.53.218 	it sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.46.24.252-00.46.25.170 	and as he says that, a r.o.u.s comes flying at him from off- screen.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.54.28.176-00.54.30.826 	buttercup, coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.58.28.920-00.58.31.520 	it keeps on coming as we finally.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.17.33.198-01.17.33.618 	then these words come to us on the wind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.32.878-01.22.39.586 	and he props westley up against a large suit of armour and takes off toward the intersection where inigo's voice came from.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.23.19.311-01.23.23.201 	inigo, behind him, coming like a streak and.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.23.57.293-01.24.00.693 	inigo, trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.39.137-01.25.46.790 	and as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
0033_Amadeus_00.00.39.751-00.00.42.521 	up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by salieri's valet.
