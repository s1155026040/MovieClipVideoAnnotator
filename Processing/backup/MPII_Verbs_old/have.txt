0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.42.26.749-00.42.27.505 	he is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.49.24.806-00.49.25.821 	the dark interior of the car has swallowed him up.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.51.50.441-00.52.04.291 	while he is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, phyllis has taken out dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.28.674-00.53.29.309 	neff has reached the top of the steps.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.54.29.181-00.54.35.656 	neff has come out and hobbled to the railing.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.56.01.248-00.56.01.367 	neff has fallen on the tracks.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.59.25.822-00.59.26.977 	charlie, the attendant has washed neff's car and is now polishing the glass and metal work.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.38.137-01.01.39.248 	neff has put down his hat and briefcase.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.45.834-01.01.46.931 	norton has gone behind his desk.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.47.046-01.01.48.282 	keyes has come in, and neff after him closes the door quietly.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.03.46.672-01.03.48.265 	the secretary has opened the door.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.04.04.585-01.04.05.233 	norton has placed a chair.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.10.29.976-01.10.31.046 	he has stopped in front of neff.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.05.591-01.12.05.775 	the hallway is empty except for phyllis who has been standing close to the door of neff's apartment, listening.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.05.845-01.12.06.652 	the door has just started to open.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.17.33.650-01.17.35.514 	in the foreground, neff and lola are having dinner.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.22.33.339-01.22.34.582 	keyes has opened the door for jackson.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.48.045-01.32.48.672 	neff has just come out of keyes' office.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.50.539-01.32.51.792 	all the employees have now left.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.00.910-01.34.01.905 	the gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.45.28.314-01.45.28.498 	neff has reached the door.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.16.841-00.04.17.239 	the huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.53.504-00.06.56.695 	the porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his point of view we can just glimpse the european talking with the conductor.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.57.492-00.06.58.610 	gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.25.433-00.11.28.046 	a wire basket has been placed on supports over the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.10.646-00.12.20.939 	it is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.22.661-00.12.26.790 	this last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the crowd, as though expecting a reaction.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.58.313-00.12.59.076 	at last gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.50.027-00.14.56.981 	gandhi, on his hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he drops it defiantly in the basket.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.07.559-00.15.14.775 	the sergeant turns from the commotion to see that gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.08.503-00.18.09.597 	they have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, run-down.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.46.100-00.18.47.168 	one youth has flicked his cigarette -- hard.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.09.601-00.20.12.731 	he has paused before an office and a young girl (sonja) has come from it to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.18.611-00.21.19.777 	smuts has risen.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.37.697-00.21.39.642 	this last remark has been directed toward charlie andrews, who sits near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.57.806-00.21.58.783 	this carries a weight and apprehension that none of the rest of the conversation has.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.12.476-00.22.16.602 	but they have come by a site where a building is being erected, and a european (kallenbach) is perched above a doorway on the half-completed structure, getting a level.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.57.334-00.22.58.160 	it has an awning spread before it.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.43.206-00.28.45.727 	this is the more sober gandhi they have come to know.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.55.238-00.28.57.426 	he has their attention now.
0011_Gandhi_00.29.40.361-00.29.50.511 	and now he gets the response he has wanted.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.34.680-00.32.40.489 	as it pulls away, tyeb mohammed and singh come up to gandhi, both made wary by the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired.
0011_Gandhi_00.33.48.886-00.33.49.538 	he has a blunt farmer's face.
0011_Gandhi_00.35.00.422-00.35.02.108 	the car with the civilian has returned in the distance.
0011_Gandhi_00.35.36.123-00.35.39.274 	the clergyman who has given charlie the use of his pulpit sits beneath it, embarrassed, but sticking resolutely to his decision to give charlie a hearing.
0011_Gandhi_00.37.29.603-00.37.35.125 	the tall civil servant has been waiting for them.
0011_Gandhi_00.38.06.045-00.38.09.146 	we have seen it before when walker spoke to smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk.
0011_Gandhi_00.38.41.355-00.38.44.452 	a wry smile, and he sits on the edge of the chair smuts has directed him to.
0011_Gandhi_00.41.44.725-00.41.51.438 	the general has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.27.800-00.42.30.227 	he speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in south africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.47.856-00.42.52.841 	an indian reporter has cornered ba behind him.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.07.623-00.43.09.513 	he has guided gandhi to the first step of the platform.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.47.774-00.43.49.280 	nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming rolls royce touring car, the top down.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.49.280-00.43.50.869 	he has seated gandhi in it beside patel, taking gandhi's knapsack.
0011_Gandhi_00.45.42.948-00.45.44.465 	gandhi has bowed to jinnah, now he looks a little startled at prakash.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.06.763-00.46.08.653 	he meets prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the gandhi of south africa.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.50.110-00.46.52.267 	gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently, penetratingly.
0011_Gandhi_00.47.12.498-00.47.19.194 	he still hasn't smiled, but gandhi and charlie have.
0011_Gandhi_00.51.16.434-00.51.21.819 	gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.36.178-00.54.38.106 	ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.15.354-00.54.17.206 	as they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.52.05.847-00.52.07.055 	she has a grip on one of gandhi's arms.
0011_Gandhi_00.55.24.070-00.55.27.615 	the camera has been moving in; now it jumps to jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.29.895-00.56.32.847 	gandhi has already started to come toward the podium.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.41.552-00.56.48.176 	he is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of jinnah's major speech has dissipated.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.45.722-00.56.46.291 	patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.46.291-00.56.46.765 	but he has half heard gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.56.160-00.56.57.001 	this is the first time we have seen them.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.57.001-00.56.57.267 	he has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium.
0011_Gandhi_00.57.33.240-00.57.35.465 	nehru has turned, having caught that last remark.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.01.463-00.59.04.790 	nehru, who has been looking at gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to patel.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.45.993-00.59.47.443 	nehru has half risen in his seat to address charlie andrews, who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has stopped dead at the sight of the car.
0011_Gandhi_01.00.41.345-01.00.42.786 	gandhi has finished the last potato.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.06.655-01.01.07.672 	they have reached the trough.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.53.268-01.01.55.359 	he hasn't moved, and neither have his friends.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.22.159-01.02.22.786 	it is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.16.449-01.04.17.962 	he has stepped down from the train.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.01.397-01.05.04.379 	it has the cold assurance of a lawyer, and the captain is a little shaken by it.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.26.986-01.05.29.027 	already he has scored a victory -- and as he moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with flushed greetings.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.56.699-01.06.00.328 	and finally meha's wife, sitting near ba, the two women listening together but meha's wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead and hardly combed, her sari dirty.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.44.391-01.07.46.391 	it contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but ba.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.52.113-01.07.53.504 	the batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.58.871-01.08.00.624 	he has looked up.
0011_Gandhi_01.10.09.865-01.10.10.796 	gandhi has remained seated, pensive.
0011_Gandhi_01.10.49.233-01.11.07.759 	he has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to charlie.
0011_Gandhi_01.14.59.672-01.15.00.522 	but even so the governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly.
0011_Gandhi_01.17.45.560-01.17.45.860 	all the others have been dressed in european clothes.
0011_Gandhi_01.18.59.373-01.19.00.815 	his stand has produced a little shock of surprise.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.44.084-01.19.44.928 	the idea has caught hold.
0011_Gandhi_01.23.24.659-01.23.25.952 	gandhi has listened to it all with a growing sense of despair.
0011_Gandhi_01.27.23.225-01.27.24.936 	only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.16.488-01.31.18.141 	we are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.18.141-01.31.21.620 	and finally the camera comes to a close shot of gandhi, matching that of dyer, whom we have just left.
0011_Gandhi_01.36.08.432-01.36.10.076 	chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, and he strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends.
0011_Gandhi_01.36.33.620-01.36.35.527 	he has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both jinnah and maulana azad during this.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.23.581-01.37.24.116 	we are still in the council room, but time has passed.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.24.116-01.37.24.796 	the indian delegation has gone, and the british are relaxing as a servant pours.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.19.223-01.38.27.129 	but it is ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_01.40.09.628-01.40.10.776 	this has sobered the audience somewhat.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.45.148-01.41.45.365 	the child's mother with two little ones hanging on her has followed him out.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.32.497-01.43.33.525 	it has a terrible sobriety.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.49.864-01.45.51.587 	two police have a man on the ground.
0011_Gandhi_01.52.51.205-01.52.54.476 	during the very last of it mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.08.577-01.56.10.064 	he has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.43.032-01.58.45.320 	its style tells us some years have passed.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.34.257-02.04.36.927 	irwin has listened; it's beginning to make a little sense.
0011_Gandhi_02.05.37.320-02.05.40.777 	irwin has turned to him.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.53.940-02.12.54.132 	he struggles to his feet, facing the policeman who has struck him.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.23.840-02.15.24.998 	we see mirabehn and some indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.34.897-02.14.35.118 	he has approached the chief police officer.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.16.202-02.24.20.449 	gandhi winds up what he has done, and starts to rise.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.20.449-02.24.24.650 	gandhi has moved toward the steps.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.26.098-02.26.30.880 	bourke-white -- who has been moving, crouching to shoot him and the light -- sags back against the wall, relaxing at last.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.43.265-02.26.44.336 	she has a smile as penetrating and warming as his.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.51.780-02.26.55.061 	bourke-white bursts into an appreciative radiance -- already she has assessed him, and been won.
0011_Gandhi_02.27.16.331-02.27.18.800 	she has gandhi in the foreground, a soldier on the wall above and behind him.
0011_Gandhi_02.28.03.775-02.28.05.542 	the garden they are in has gone to seed a bit, but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.47.943-02.31.49.348 	azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.36.279-02.36.37.178 	he turns to see that mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.56.975-02.37.01.932 	we have pulled back and we see a whole gathering of hindu youths near the entrance to the ashram.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.13.553-02.37.15.158 	nehru has stepped out onto the porch and he glares at the youths.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.19.051-02.37.19.911 	it is his presence that has silenced them.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.00.795-02.38.02.112 	we have seen azad and pyarelal come out on the porch behind nehru.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.36.756-02.38.38.669 	they are all awed, timid even in his actual presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.05.160-02.38.08.008 	as they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.23.558-02.39.26.909 	he has been looking at gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.46.287-02.39.48.243 	and jinnah has drawn himself up.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.16.834-02.40.19.402 	they have all been taken by surprise by the offer -- and do not feel what gandhi feels.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.38.132-02.40.44.915 	gandhi's eyes sag with the despair of a man whose last hope, whose faith, has crumbled around him.
0011_Gandhi_02.44.42.295-02.44.47.168 	patel and azad are there and pyarelal of course, and with them now the giant figure of abdul ghaffar khan, the first time we have seen him among gandhi's intimate group.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.26.131-02.45.32.007 	he has turned and seen gandhi standing slowly.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.32.007-02.45.35.940 	it has almost stopped him.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.12.833-02.48.13.974 	nehru lowers his head again; it is like another burden on a man who already has too many.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.36.061-02.48.37.931 	they are whispering quietly, but mirabehn has stopped on seeing nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting.
0011_Gandhi_02.49.32.370-02.49.36.019 	but nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair.
0011_Gandhi_02.51.54.220-02.51.56.690 	the crowd has spread from him all along the street; they stand against the walls of the houses staring at him, terrified to move.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.18.724-02.55.20.114 	it is as though the man has told him of some terrible self- inflicted wound.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.02.634-02.56.06.972 	he raises his hand to the height nahari has indicated as his son's.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.51.119-02.55.54.336 	nahari has listened.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.02.583-03.00.04.418 	but bourke-white has looked from patel to gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in patel's words.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.30.110-03.00.34.753 	abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.56.511-03.01.00.182 	he moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to patel.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.08.857-03.01.09.254 	he has passed her, he's in the doorway.

0026_The_Big_Fish_00.27.08.240-00.27.09.316 	the ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.44.419-00.28.45.945 	the road has narrowed to a rough path.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.51.542-00.28.52.718 	for the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.29.58.891-00.30.01.052 	one is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.04.809-00.30.14.979 	at his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.56.753-00.30.57.256 	friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.36.47.028-00.37.02.759 	lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold fiddlers.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.37.16.767-00.37.20.410 	before he can protest, two women have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.37.46.604-00.37.50.997 	still, he's having a blast.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.26.122-00.40.30.889 	but the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him.

0026_The_Big_Fish_01.26.52.772-01.26.55.867 	caught, edward has to confess.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.29.04.745-01.29.08.744 	when they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes.

0030_The_Hustler_01.27.35.831-01.27.40.595 	he knocks on the door with his wrist, as he would if he still had them on.
0030_The_Hustler_01.29.30.235-01.29.30.817 	eddie and sarah had walked past it the first day they met.

0030_The_Hustler_01.32.34.729-01.32.37.807 	eddie, having hurriedly paid the bill, follows after her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.35.591-01.43.36.539 	sarah has been drinking.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.58.866-01.43.59.218 	he is tall and refined, with a pale, debauched, yet oddly youthful face that some men of forty or more sometimes have.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.06.52.792-00.06.54.847 	wick, who has been smoking a cigarette throughout the scene, throws it out the window.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.07.59.205-00.08.00.629 	wick has twisted the string off the bottle.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.06.690-00.08.07.601 	wick has stepped to the sink.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.16.893-00.08.19.636 	don has something of the feeling of a man watching the execution of a very good friend, but he senses helen's eyes upon him and preserves his nonchalant expression.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.08.50.458-00.08.55.805 	wick turns toward don, who has followed helen to the entrance hall.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.29.126-00.38.29.989 	as we have left it, empty save for nat and don.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.40.57.494-00.41.01.404 	when he has reached the security of some potted palms, he looks back.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.42.11.204-00.42.15.054 	helen has hung up too.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.43.23.782-00.43.28.270 	wick has bent over don and loosened his tie.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.43.40.988-00.43.44.963 	paying no attention to the sound of steps which has been coming from the staircase, wick rises, puts the glass of whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, short.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.45.02.306-00.45.04.208 	from under the couch has rolled the bottle.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.11.289-00.56.18.849 	he puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out what cash he has.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.17.349-00.56.21.234 	he hasn't enough -- only two one-dollar bills and some small change.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.59.33.816-00.59.36.903 	he fishes what money he has left from his pocket.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.00.30.033-01.00.35.681 	don has entered.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.18.879-01.14.22.914 	don has risen.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.02.854-01.26.04.175 	apparently the bat has seized the mouse in its claws.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.12.425-01.26.14.327 	she must have been listening from don's first scream.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.28.07.149-01.28.08.410 	dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.44.938-01.30.47.528 	don has already reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to helen.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.39.13.803-01.39.18.509 	don has risen from the couch and has picked up the glass of whiskey.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.39.32.994-01.39.35.026 	don has sunk back on the couch again.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.13.275-00.01.16.260 	he has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to the kid, pinches his cheek.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.06.37.747-00.06.38.138 	(we haven't yet.)
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.09.13.059-00.09.18.140 	during this, inigo has gone close to fezzik, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.12.01.548-00.12.11.182 	she's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- --and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her-- --and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- --and buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- --and the eel slithers closer, closer-- --and buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- --and now the eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.00.913-00.16.02.505 	once they might have been a fort, now the kind of resemble stonehenge.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.23.196-00.17.23.868 	he is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.18.37.134-00.18.41.057 	he raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.11.314-00.23.17.489 	a rocky staircase leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the man in black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop inigo--nothing can stop inigo--and in a frenzy, the man in black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.03.652-00.26.05.971 	he has picked up another rock and holds it lightly.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.42.154-00.26.43.746 	the man in black is not now and has never been a shrimp.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.14.970-00.27.28.022 	fezzik considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the man in black slips down to avoid the charge, fezzik moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the man in black jumps for fezzik's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have fezzik's throat, locked across fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.53.992-00.27.56.917 	again fezzik slams the man in black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and fezzik starts to slowly collapse.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.31.20.045-00.31.21.562 	as vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the man in black's has been fast disappearing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.33.13.771-00.33.15.626 	vizzini, busily switching the goblets while the man in black has his head turned.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.35.234-00.38.37.656 	buttercup, and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.42.050-00.38.43.062 	buttercup, staring transfixed at what she has wrought.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.43.40.090-00.43.48.857 	the two of them have by now crossed the pond.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.17.818-00.44.23.907 	buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way--it's lightning sand--a great patch of it, and it has her--a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying westley's name but then she is gone as we.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.48.660-00.44.53.218 	it sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.58.325-00.45.05.166 	the lightning sand, as westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.45.38.619-00.45.40.656 	she's still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.48.27.551-00.48.28.467 	something we hadn't expected: humperdinck on his horse, rugen beside him.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.06.10.993-01.06.11.595 	and there has never been such pain.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.07.14.267-01.07.16.568 	and fezzik crunches the albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.08.21.884-01.08.23.085 	he has failed.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.14.20.951-01.14.23.796 	during this, fezzik, using all his strength, has managed to get westley into a right angled sitting position, while inigo brings out the miracle pill.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.49.622-01.18.53.034 	he has an impediment that would stop a clock.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.09.687-01.21.14.988 	actually fezzik is dragging westley, who is, in turn, dragging yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash--westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.40.833-01.21.47.637 	and as his warriors attack-- inigo goes wild, and maybe the warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that--but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the fourth warrior is dead before the first one has even hit the floor.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.05.900-01.26.07.785 	count rugen, stepping back for just a moment, watching as inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the count is about to strike again, inigo manages a little flick of his own and rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.42.912-01.26.45.270 	inigo drives for the count's left shoulder now, thrusts home where the count had gotten him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.27.24.456-01.27.25.470 	westley lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, yellin's sword at his side.

0033_Amadeus_01.54.10.174-01.54.12.489 	but he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him, searching for him and then finds him.
0033_Amadeus_02.21.46.545-02.21.48.711 	constanze has come into the living room.
0033_Amadeus_02.34.42.290-02.34.51.441 	salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre.
0033_Amadeus_02.35.02.290-02.35.02.538 	he has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as the three attendants in the magic flute.
0033_Amadeus_02.43.31.872-02.43.33.917 	the carriage has arrived.
0038_Psycho_00.03.18.860-00.03.30.168 	mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him.
0038_Psycho_00.05.01.567-00.05.03.375 	she stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in.

0038_Psycho_00.18.44.843-00.18.49.268 	she stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a los angeles newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
0038_Psycho_00.19.43.943-00.19.48.002 	she has seen the patrolman.
0038_Psycho_00.19.49.106-00.19.50.978 	mary has to force herself to look away.

0038_Psycho_00.28.13.632-00.28.18.373 	he gets to the porch a moment after mary has reached it.
0038_Psycho_00.28.27.951-00.28.29.478 	mary has placed her handbag on the counter.
0038_Psycho_00.29.34.551-00.29.36.172 	the rain has slowed down considerably.
0038_Psycho_00.32.53.544-00.32.56.588 	mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy.
0038_Psycho_00.35.30.166-00.35.33.459 	norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs.
0038_Psycho_01.05.17.470-01.05.22.040 	norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies arbogast, who has remained standing by the door.

0038_Psycho_01.27.58.928-01.28.00.771 	she smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity fandango, takes the sheriff's arm, starts away.
0038_Psycho_01.29.24.399-01.29.25.805 	sam and lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.
0038_Psycho_01.29.51.504-01.29.57.571 	when sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to norman.
0038_Psycho_01.38.10.613-01.38.12.548 	sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.
0038_Psycho_01.41.16.864-01.41.18.804 	the eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and flaky.
0038_Psycho_01.42.08.826-01.42.11.789 	a young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into the room.
0038_Psycho_01.47.36.635-01.47.38.087 	the room has a quality of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.12.23.325-00.12.25.535 	he has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.26.50.063-00.26.52.192 	elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction lee had walked up.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.28.56.410-00.29.01.268 	the film leaves elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.36.52.899-00.36.54.982 	lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has opened the door for elliot and his client, wealthy rock star dusty frye.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.37.49.348-00.37.51.719 	indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the turkish agent.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.38.06.207-00.38.11.386 	turning, indy sees that elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat.
