0030_The_Hustler_00.02.48.303-00.02.54.930 	but eddie pats the corner pocket confidently, leans over, and raps out his shot.

0030_The_Hustler_00.36.02.995-00.36.07.436 	charlie slaps eddie's cheeks.
0030_The_Hustler_00.36.53.405-00.37.17.725 	then eddie returns to his bed, leaves the keys to the packard and some money on the night table next to charlie.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.04.631-00.38.08.363 	eddie looks at him, shaking his head.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.10.141-00.38.17.894 	eddie laughs to himself, puts his hanging bag and cue case on a chair, then turns to face his image in the mirror.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.58.667-00.39.00.593 	moving toward the counter, eddie notices sarah.

0030_The_Hustler_00.48.30.059-00.48.36.288 	then eddie takes the bag of scotch and places it underneath her arm.
0030_The_Hustler_00.48.43.237-00.48.48.881 	a hotel manager shows eddie into a dingy, barely furnished room.
0030_The_Hustler_00.49.02.669-00.49.13.585 	eddie removes his bags from the locker.
0030_The_Hustler_00.50.22.717-00.50.30.444 	eddie walks casually by the pool table and over to the bar.
0030_The_Hustler_00.51.27.351-00.51.30.217 	eddie sits at a table, smoking, waiting.
0030_The_Hustler_00.55.22.011-00.55.33.701 	she unloads liquor and canned goods from the carton, then goes to join eddie by the window.

0030_The_Hustler_00.59.43.052-00.59.45.853 	eddie leans up against the wall, listening.
0030_The_Hustler_01.00.48.373-01.00.49.947 	suddenly eddie becomes tense.
0030_The_Hustler_01.02.43.878-01.02.46.651 	eddie walks off.
0030_The_Hustler_01.04.46.483-01.04.49.941 	sarah hands eddie his drink without looking him in the eye.
0030_The_Hustler_01.06.07.509-01.06.09.909 	eddie stares at sarah as she sways limply on her knees, unmindful of her open robe.
0030_The_Hustler_01.07.22.098-01.07.25.159 	eddie walks off.
0030_The_Hustler_01.07.45.325-01.07.48.527 	eddie gives her a look, then lowers his eyes.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.41.746-01.09.44.101 	eddie looks at bert.
0030_The_Hustler_01.14.48.489-01.14.50.983 	eddie exits.
0030_The_Hustler_01.14.54.393-01.15.07.216 	eddie walks past the piers and warehouses toward a small waterfront bar called arthur's pool hall.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.23.591-01.17.25.591 	preparing to break, eddie chalks his cue.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.57.817-01.17.59.764 	eddie finishes up with yet another combination shot.
0030_The_Hustler_01.18.56.112-01.19.03.096 	eddie tries to back off but there is nowhere to go, so he makes a casual movement toward the table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.19.21.801-01.19.27.117 	they drag eddie into the men's room and shove him up against the ground-glass partition.
0030_The_Hustler_01.21.57.738-01.22.07.955 	she is at her table, typing, while eddie stands at the window, trying to reach over his shoulder to scratch his back.
0030_The_Hustler_01.23.42.982-01.23.46.500 	sarah and eddie emerges from the doorway.
0030_The_Hustler_01.23.59.038-01.24.02.852 	eddie leans back on the grass and looks at sarah.
0030_The_Hustler_01.26.42.833-01.26.47.343 	eddie lowers his eyes and leans back.
0030_The_Hustler_01.27.04.759-01.27.11.043 	eddie just stares at her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.27.55.859-01.28.01.751 	eddie flexes his fingers, then tries out a shot on one of johnny's pool tables.
0030_The_Hustler_01.30.44.053-01.30.49.218 	the waiter returns with the bottle of sherry and holds it out to eddie for his approval.
0030_The_Hustler_01.30.52.083-01.30.55.108 	finally, eddie realizes he must respond.
0030_The_Hustler_01.31.16.303-01.31.20.405 	then eddie looks away.
0030_The_Hustler_01.31.39.115-01.31.42.492 	eddie nods and drinks down the last of his brandy as the waiter leaves.
0030_The_Hustler_01.32.34.729-01.32.37.807 	eddie, having hurriedly paid the bill, follows after her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.32.44.704-01.32.46.085 	eddie grabs sarah and starts to pull her back under the awning.
0030_The_Hustler_01.36.34.507-01.36.35.385 	eddie shuts the door.

0030_The_Hustler_01.38.14.462-01.38.17.165 	eddie glances at sarah who stares mutely at bert.
0030_The_Hustler_01.40.13.909-01.40.19.686 	eddie laughs and moves toward the open door leading to the billiard rooms.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.22.307-01.43.24.904 	eddie cashes in a winning ticket.
0030_The_Hustler_01.44.27.076-01.44.27.592 	bert points to eddie.
0030_The_Hustler_01.48.15.770-01.48.16.978 	eddie shoves through the gawking crowd.
0030_The_Hustler_01.48.16.978-01.48.21.111 	eddie tries to take her in his arms, but she beats on his chest, sobbing, unable to make words.
0030_The_Hustler_01.48.21.111-01.48.29.959 	eddie drags her limp, trembling body across the dance floor to the stairs.
0030_The_Hustler_01.49.15.121-01.49.18.531 	eddie looks at sarah for a moment, then turns and walks out.
0030_The_Hustler_01.49.18.531-01.49.26.629 	findley, drink and cork-tipped cigarette in hand, escorts bert and eddie down the stairs to his game room.
0030_The_Hustler_01.49.42.596-01.49.44.914 	eddie eagerly pulls back the cloth that covers the table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.50.22.566-01.50.25.524 	eddie finishes uncovering the table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.50.53.907-01.50.59.603 	findley steps up to the bar, leaving bert and eddie alone.
0030_The_Hustler_01.52.21.401-01.52.22.534 	eddie stands helplessly for a moment.
0030_The_Hustler_01.53.25.608-01.53.29.141 	bert eyes eddie with controlled rage as the two get ready to play again.
0030_The_Hustler_01.55.29.139-01.55.30.244 	eddie leans against a wall nearby.
0030_The_Hustler_01.56.47.889-01.56.49.211 	eddie waits for bert to come down the stairs.
0030_The_Hustler_01.57.16.562-01.57.19.112 	eddie abruptly turns and walks out of the house.
0030_The_Hustler_02.01.15.038-02.01.21.758 	eddie walks quickly toward the elevators.
0030_The_Hustler_02.01.49.709-02.01.50.739 	a uniformed policeman bars eddie's entrance.
0030_The_Hustler_02.02.02.794-02.02.10.657 	eddie pushes by the photographer, then stops as he sees sarah's body laid out on the tiled floor.
0030_The_Hustler_02.02.30.752-02.02.35.163 	eddie reaches out to touch her, then pulls back his hand.
0030_The_Hustler_02.03.00.945-02.03.05.901 	a policeman untangles them, but eddie breaks free.
0030_The_Hustler_02.05.50.341-02.05.54.856 	eddie looks at the lineup of the balls.
0030_The_Hustler_02.07.50.988-02.07.56.111 	eddie looks significantly at fats who lowers his eyes and puffs on his cigarette.
0030_The_Hustler_02.07.58.268-02.08.02.005 	eddie sinks shots right and left -- some tricky, some not.
0030_The_Hustler_02.08.44.194-02.08.46.578 	but eddie is shooting pool now, making all his shots quickly and accurately.
0030_The_Hustler_02.09.18.324-02.09.25.571 	eddie slips into the jacket, helped by preacher.
0030_The_Hustler_02.10.25.670-02.10.35.055 	eddie unscrews his cue, thinking it over.
0030_The_Hustler_02.12.57.032-02.13.02.298 	eddie puts away his cue.
0030_The_Hustler_02.13.19.316-02.13.24.178 	eddie just stares at bert, then looks over at the downcast face of minnesota fats.
1009_Spider-Man3_01.07.29.877-01.07.39.579 	eddie brock jumps out of a camp, camera at the ready as black spider-man tears the heavy grill from the ground.
