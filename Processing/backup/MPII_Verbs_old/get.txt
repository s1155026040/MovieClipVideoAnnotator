0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.41.08.149-00.41.14.028 	there is a greeting, some conversation apparently about don and the fact that he'll get there any minute.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.45.12.836-00.45.20.519 	as helen speaks, he tries to get near it without her noticing.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.58.06.964-00.58.10.492 	as don picks up the cake of soap, he watches the attendant get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.58.39.033-00.58.42.992 	the attendant doesn't get the joke but chuckles automatically and opens the door into the bar.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.59.50.461-00.59.51.643 	by this time they've got don to the door.

0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.18.833-00.14.19.538 	finally, he himself gets in the harness.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.34.935-00.14.36.002 	this is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and it's a gasper.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.15.10.427-00.15.14.492 	vizzini and the others, and it's getting too close now.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.28.530-00.26.36.522 	he gets set to throw, but the man in black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the giant.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.01.645-00.27.03.833 	they get set to begin again.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.36.24.797-00.36.26.146 	below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.58.05.630-00.58.11.901 	and then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets the machine going.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.11.48.769-01.11.52.426 	he goes to get a huge bellows.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.14.20.951-01.14.23.796 	during this, fezzik, using all his strength, has managed to get westley into a right angled sitting position, while inigo brings out the miracle pill.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.07.120-01.18.11.325 	westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.40.833-01.21.47.637 	and as his warriors attack-- inigo goes wild, and maybe the warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that--but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the fourth warrior is dead before the first one has even hit the floor.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.23.57.293-01.24.00.693 	inigo, trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.24.173-01.26.25.780 	none of the count's blows get home.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.33.470-01.26.34.693 	but none of his blows get through and, slowly, inigo, again moves forward.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.42.912-01.26.45.270 	inigo drives for the count's left shoulder now, thrusts home where the count had gotten him.
0033_Amadeus_00.12.41.935-00.12.44.651 	all the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.37.748-00.17.39.613 	instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches the chamberlain and whispers in his ear.
0033_Amadeus_01.02.29.505-01.02.32.400 	constanze gets up, perplexed.
0033_Amadeus_01.22.14.138-01.22.15.027 	as leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting constanze's wig firmly onto his head.

0038_Psycho_00.27.38.486-00.27.43.320 	mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get some attention.
0038_Psycho_00.27.43.571-00.27.51.737 	she dashes out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, begins to honk the horn.
0038_Psycho_00.28.13.632-00.28.18.373 	he gets to the porch a moment after mary has reached it.
0038_Psycho_00.29.32.163-00.29.42.334 	mary follows him to the door, goes out on the porch, waits and watches as norman runs to her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of cabin one.
0038_Psycho_00.29.38.031-00.29.46.008 	norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches on a light.
0038_Psycho_00.49.46.542-00.49.54.600 	the camera now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we hear, coming from within the house, the sound of norman's fearful, shocked voice.
0038_Psycho_01.01.50.824-01.01.53.717 	bob gets the message, goes out through the back way.
0038_Psycho_01.12.22.096-01.12.25.853 	the car pulls up and arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor running.
0038_Psycho_01.12.26.118-01.12.31.360 	arbogast gets to the phone booth, enters.

0038_Psycho_01.14.38.799-01.14.46.092 	arbogast gets out.
0038_Psycho_01.34.33.075-01.34.41.788 	sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for lila and himself to pass through.
0038_Psycho_01.47.17.570-01.47.21.310 	a guard in uniform is posted by the door, looking reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance into the room.
