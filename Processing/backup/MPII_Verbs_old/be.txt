0001_American_Beauty_00.04.05.082-00.04.08.693 	carolyn is driving; jane stares out the window.
0001_American_Beauty_00.04.12.169-00.04.18.224 	lester is asleep in the back seat.
0001_American_Beauty_00.04.27.897-00.04.30.762 	the beleaguered expression on his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice.
0001_American_Beauty_00.04.51.145-00.04.54.900 	brad, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes lester, who is unaware of his presence.
0001_American_Beauty_00.05.08.318-00.05.12.770 	brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.
0001_American_Beauty_00.06.17.132-00.06.18.656 	a moving van is parked in front of the colonial house next door to the burnhams'.

0001_American_Beauty_00.07.29.926-00.07.36.739 	carolyn is watching this closely.
0001_American_Beauty_00.08.23.610-00.08.25.217 	lester is quiet, staring at his plate.
0001_American_Beauty_00.09.54.433-00.09.55.145 	ricky is eighteen, but his eyes are much older.
0001_American_Beauty_00.10.03.979-00.10.06.234 	we're looking out through the kitchen window at the point where ricky was just standing, but he's no longer there.
0001_American_Beauty_00.10.07.367-00.10.08.408 	his head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched.
0001_American_Beauty_00.11.02.154-00.11.21.276 	we see carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she: cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom; and vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.
0001_American_Beauty_00.11.25.089-00.11.30.847 	she says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off.
0001_American_Beauty_00.12.07.637-00.12.08.788 	the woman is pregnant.
0001_American_Beauty_00.14.05.000-00.14.07.938 	seated in the bleachers, next to the high school band, is a group of about twenty teenage girls, dressed in pale blue and white uniforms.
0001_American_Beauty_00.14.12.679-00.14.21.632 	at sixteen, angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the archetypal american dream girl.
0001_American_Beauty_00.14.30.217-00.14.33.229 	lester is slumped in the passenger seat.
0001_American_Beauty_00.15.35.706-00.15.39.654 	dancing awkwardly next to her is angela.
0001_American_Beauty_00.16.36.417-00.16.38.224 	lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.
0001_American_Beauty_00.17.16.562-00.17.17.584 	angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other girls.
0001_American_Beauty_00.17.23.644-00.17.24.302 	the game is long over.
0001_American_Beauty_00.18.20.803-00.18.25.170 	he is mesmerized; grateful, even.

0001_American_Beauty_00.19.52.435-00.20.00.956 	she looks down at us with a smile that is all things.
0001_American_Beauty_00.21.35.720-00.21.37.302 	we're looking at the colonial house next door where the moving van was parked earlier.
0001_American_Beauty_00.21.37.626-00.21.38.182 	the front porch is shrouded in darkness.
0001_American_Beauty_00.22.02.845-00.22.09.179 	she quickly turns off the light that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window.
0001_American_Beauty_00.22.48.667-00.22.52.317 	lester is frozen, unable to speak.
0001_American_Beauty_00.23.09.042-00.23.09.977 	angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone.
0001_American_Beauty_00.25.33.995-00.25.36.333 	in the passenger seat, ricky is using a calculator and jotting numbers down in a notebook.
0001_American_Beauty_00.25.56.289-00.25.56.933 	a beat, as ricky continues his calculations, before he realizes a response is expected from him.
0001_American_Beauty_00.26.11.618-00.26.13.670 	the colonel is taken aback but quickly covers.

0001_American_Beauty_00.29.20.377-00.29.20.937 	the colonel is smiling, enjoying the show; barbara just stares.
0001_American_Beauty_00.31.34.890-00.31.37.039 	carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.
0001_American_Beauty_00.31.56.956-00.31.58.234 	carolyn is talking to buddy and christy.
0001_American_Beauty_00.32.41.726-00.32.43.173 	carolyn and buddy are deep in conversation.
0001_American_Beauty_00.32.46.016-00.32.47.387 	carolyn is nervous; buddy seems amused.
0001_American_Beauty_00.33.45.933-00.33.47.881 	this situation is loaded and they both know it.
0001_American_Beauty_00.34.50.111-00.34.50.820 	carolyn is standing in the open service entrance.
0001_American_Beauty_00.35.51.723-00.35.52.768 	jane and angela are watching mtv.
0001_American_Beauty_00.36.17.414-00.36.30.666 	he turns, and is instantly transfixed by: angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair.
0001_American_Beauty_00.37.31.757-00.37.32.918 	angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer.
0001_American_Beauty_00.41.30.345-00.41.30.531 	his room is a haven of high-tech.
0001_American_Beauty_00.41.31.786-00.41.31.965 	there is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room.
0001_American_Beauty_00.42.33.357-00.42.36.611 	lester is awake, staring at the ceiling.
0001_American_Beauty_00.43.08.091-00.43.09.668 	the room is filled with steam.
0001_American_Beauty_00.43.09.903-00.43.17.966 	lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: across from us, in a pedestal bathtub, is angela.
0001_American_Beauty_00.46.47.601-00.47.00.923 	the colonel is washing his ford explorer, squatting to scrub the bumper, when something catches his eye: lester and the jims jog down the street.
0001_American_Beauty_00.50.27.102-00.50.27.517 	the garage is in the process of becoming lester's sanctuary.
0001_American_Beauty_00.51.26.234-00.51.29.162 	brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document.
0001_American_Beauty_00.53.06.770-00.53.09.092 	he's happier than he's been in years.
0001_American_Beauty_00.53.11.053-00.53.12.768 	there are two menus on the table.

0001_American_Beauty_00.57.44.449-00.57.49.278 	carolyn and buddy are in bed, post-sex.
0001_American_Beauty_00.58.35.006-00.58.39.528 	carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for another round.
0001_American_Beauty_01.00.32.874-01.00.34.278 	the room is spotless.
0001_American_Beauty_01.01.18.723-01.01.20.326 	close on the bottom of the plate: a small swastika is imprinted in the center.
0001_American_Beauty_01.02.00.693-01.02.01.497 	something is floating across from us.
0001_American_Beauty_01.03.41.977-01.03.45.242 	now jane is watching him.
0001_American_Beauty_01.07.33.598-01.07.33.858 	jane is sitting on her bed.
0001_American_Beauty_01.07.33.858-01.07.35.220 	there is a knock at the door.
0001_American_Beauty_01.10.54.059-01.10.55.685 	suddenly, the door is thrown open and the colonel enters, incensed.
0001_American_Beauty_01.10.57.466-01.10.58.092 	ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the colonel is too fast; he punches ricky in the face, knocking him to the floor.
0001_American_Beauty_01.11.01.450-01.11.01.531 	ricky's lip is bleeding, but he maintains a steady gaze at his father during this violence.
0001_American_Beauty_01.11.47.619-01.11.51.113 	the colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed.
0001_American_Beauty_01.13.29.905-01.13.35.396 	carolyn, wearing protective headgear, is holding a glock 19 automatic revolver with both hands, firing it directly at us.
0001_American_Beauty_01.13.51.852-01.13.59.724 	her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is.
0001_American_Beauty_01.14.47.434-01.14.48.530 	lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a beer and controlling the car.
0001_American_Beauty_01.14.49.635-01.14.52.282 	lester's remote-controlled model jeep is zooming across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing.
0001_American_Beauty_01.15.25.348-01.15.26.283 	his working out is beginning to produce results.
0001_American_Beauty_01.15.40.403-01.15.42.550 	it's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone.
0001_American_Beauty_01.15.46.044-01.15.46.318 	his face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged.
0001_American_Beauty_01.17.11.354-01.17.13.284 	his smile fades, and the moment is gone.
0001_American_Beauty_01.25.00.941-01.25.01.297 	jane is stunned.
0001_American_Beauty_01.25.10.369-01.25.10.609 	the scars on his face are almost gone now.
0001_American_Beauty_01.25.12.027-01.25.15.897 	then ricky looks up at him, and the colonel is suddenly self- conscious.
0001_American_Beauty_01.26.49.578-01.26.50.883 	the camera is still connected to the tv.
0001_American_Beauty_01.26.55.667-01.27.05.945 	smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill.
0001_American_Beauty_01.27.24.723-01.27.25.457 	they are too involved with each other to notice lester watching them from the drive-thru window.
0001_American_Beauty_01.28.28.171-01.28.28.660 	the sky is filled with ominous gray clouds.
0001_American_Beauty_01.29.49.438-01.29.56.879 	he puts the weights down and looks at his reflection in the window: his arms are pumped.
0001_American_Beauty_01.31.20.350-01.31.22.786 	our view is blurred by the rain, but we see lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of bills.
0001_American_Beauty_01.32.10.309-01.32.11.369 	from our perspective, it looks very much like ricky is giving lester a blow job.
0001_American_Beauty_01.33.12.269-01.33.12.928 	but something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all.
0001_American_Beauty_01.33.13.782-01.33.15.180 	his voice is low and intense.
0001_American_Beauty_01.34.47.724-01.34.51.843 	he's finally discovered a way to break free from his father, and he can't believe it was this simple.
0001_American_Beauty_01.35.32.306-01.35.36.385 	she's obviously heard his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes, searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.
0001_American_Beauty_01.37.06.056-01.37.06.912 	angela is sprawled across the bed.
0001_American_Beauty_01.37.07.371-01.37.09.715 	there is a knock on the door.
0001_American_Beauty_01.39.13.751-01.39.14.061 	and then he glances at us, suddenly aware he's being watched.
0001_American_Beauty_01.39.23.129-01.39.24.694 	the rain is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp clap of thunder.
0001_American_Beauty_01.41.18.866-01.41.20.263 	lester is momentarily stunned, and then he pushes the colonel away.
0001_American_Beauty_01.42.07.599-01.42.07.984 	carolyn is still listening to the same motivational tape.
0001_American_Beauty_01.43.08.131-01.43.08.719 	she's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed.
0001_American_Beauty_01.44.17.753-01.44.20.763 	they stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged.
0001_American_Beauty_01.44.25.845-01.44.27.685 	he is sexy.
0001_American_Beauty_01.44.34.848-01.44.42.265 	she's unnerved--this is happening too fast.
0001_American_Beauty_01.44.53.895-01.44.57.507 	she's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's pretty bad at it.
0001_American_Beauty_01.45.05.836-01.45.06.916 	his face is very close to hers.
0001_American_Beauty_01.47.55.109-01.47.58.549 	this is not the mythically carnal creature of lester's fantasies; this is a nervous child.
0001_American_Beauty_01.51.47.013-01.51.51.786 	instantly, the tile is sprayed with blood, the same deep crimson as the roses.
0001_American_Beauty_01.52.12.796-01.52.15.696 	a pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table.
0001_American_Beauty_01.52.42.415-01.52.45.310 	lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile.
0001_American_Beauty_01.54.16.410-01.54.21.284 	he paces in front of one of his gun cases; the glass door is open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside.
0001_American_Beauty_01.55.05.110-01.55.21.331 	we're watching the video ricky showed jane earlier, of the empty white plastic bag being blown about.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.00.46.874-00.00.59.356 	right now all his considerable talent and strength is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.01.25.124-00.01.39.871 	the dog takes a snap at melvin, but the man is much meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.01.59.927-00.02.03.799 	melvin is just about to enter his apartment.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.02.09.981-00.02.11.787 	melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite simon's.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.06.39.104-00.06.41.355 	melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close the door when simon has another burst of bravery.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.09.17.955-00.09.18.277 	melvin is scared.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.10.26.564-00.10.28.109 	his walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.10.30.093-00.10.35.136 	we will be very pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.10.45.559-00.10.47.403 	she is telling a story about her son for the umpteenth time.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.11.16.905-00.11.20.049 	they turn away -- melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where two waitresses, lisa and carol, are talking.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.13.01.947-00.13.02.350 	there is in carol's attitude toward melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the place who can handle him.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.14.59.691-00.15.06.253 	she is underneath a younger, cuter man on the living room sofa.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.16.13.179-00.16.13.365 	the room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.16.53.935-00.16.55.452 	he is taking a cigarette from a pack.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.19.21.630-00.19.33.595 	chatting away unaware that vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.19.48.780-00.19.52.081 	vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy simon.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.20.48.528-00.20.52.125 	he feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.25.570-00.21.26.560 	carol and leslie, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.26.560-00.21.27.112 	leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.28.366-00.21.28.632 	though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary on her every action.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.23.30.165-00.23.32.664 	the greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of vincent.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.24.07.800-00.24.10.248 	where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all objects into large sacks -- one of them, doug, pauses to look past the terrace to the studio.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.25.59.405-00.26.00.443 	a mass of official people clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.26.04.527-00.26.08.443 	frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash and verdell, who is more upset making pathetic little crying.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.26.35.889-00.26.49.031 	frank is talking to the sweet-faced woman.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.29.15.226-00.29.16.688 	his recent past making him suspect this feast is a trick.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.30.37.259-00.30.38.024 	simon's face is something of a horror.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.30.39.206-00.30.39.766 	the sight is a jolt.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.32.52.476-00.32.55.004 	melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye of his dog.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.34.17.975-00.34.23.522 	she is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.34.31.765-00.34.33.553 	melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.41.40.122-00.41.42.220 	melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough he must go through a careful exercise noting every new element before he's at all comfortable.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.52.56.977-00.52.57.738 	she is ebullient which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.03.37.093-01.03.40.369 	as she enters building and realizes it's not just that she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet t-shirt contest.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.20.44.016-01.20.46.594 	melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a camera).
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.20.56.618-01.20.57.618 	this is an amazing development.

0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.05.40.712-02.05.43.350 	turning as the sudden blast of being buzzed into carol's life sounds.

0003_CASABLANCA_00.04.17.006-00.04.19.699 	suspects are herded out of the van, and into the palais de justice.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.04.20.381-00.04.22.042 	at the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the police.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.04.35.859-00.04.44.190 	the englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display of concern.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.04.45.809-00.04.51.159 	as he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes there is something missing.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.13.757-00.05.15.103 	as the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.23.363-00.05.25.335 	in the group is captain louis renault, a french officer appointed by vichy as prefect of police in casablanca.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.25.479-00.05.28.541 	when the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale german with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.28.963-00.05.34.485 	with him are herr heinze, the german consul, captain tonelli, an italian officer, and lieutenant casselle, renault's aide.

0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.45.996-00.05.47.435 	he is a handsome, middle-aged frenchman, debonair and gay, but withal a shrewd and alert official.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.06.28.945-00.06.31.500 	the neon sign above the door is brightly lit.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.06.50.290-00.06.53.502 	rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.06.53.502-00.06.56.678 	the occupants of the room are varied.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.06.56.678-00.07.02.668 	there are europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.07.08.783-00.07.16.980 	there are moroccans in silk robes.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.07.30.380-00.07.31.164 	sympathy is evidently in short supply in casablanca.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.08.09.435-00.08.11.300 	carl, the waiter, is a fat, jovial german refugee with spectacles.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.08.14.542-00.08.19.240 	their is much activity at the various tables.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.09.09.608-00.09.10.400 	rick is an american of indeterminate age.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.09.12.278-00.09.13.988 	there is a commotion at the door as people attempt to come into the gambling room.

0003_CASABLANCA_00.12.44.340-00.12.47.980 	the cafe is in semi-darkness.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.13.08.572-00.13.10.778 	during one of the periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, rick slips the letters of transit into the piano.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.16.40.712-00.16.48.082 	his look isn't a happy one.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.17.40.263-00.17.45.707 	they start upstairs to rick's office, passing casselle who is still haranguing tonelli.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.18.00.658-00.18.07.675 	only rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.22.33.445-00.22.34.549 	back to rick, still standing where he was, as a customer walks by.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.22.39.192-00.22.42.105 	a few customers are on the point of leaving.

0003_CASABLANCA_00.25.20.247-00.25.21.002 	they are victor laszlo, the czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman wearing a simple white gown, miss ilsa lund.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.25.31.401-00.25.32.092 	she is so beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.27.14.850-00.27.15.770 	ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low and soft.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.28.03.261-00.28.04.938 	there is not the slightest recognition from either ilsa or laszlo.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.28.05.958-00.28.08.178 	strasser waits to be asked to seat himself.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.28.58.343-00.28.59.346 	ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.31.20.603-00.31.26.809 	he sits down and is ready to play.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.31.39.018-00.31.44.005 	he is nervous, waiting for anything.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.36.34.367-00.36.36.272 	sam now realizes rick is in a very grim mood.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.39.30.991-00.39.33.421 	they seem to be transported by each other as ilsa laughs.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.40.20.229-00.40.30.533 	they appear to be very much in love as the music plays.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.41.44.664-00.41.48.397 	there is much excitement.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.42.47.877-00.42.50.120 	there is evidently something on her mind.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.42.53.584-00.42.56.701 	his manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in casablanca.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.44.19.933-00.44.21.361 	while they are locked in an embrace they hear the dull boom of cannons.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.22.394-00.46.30.496 	he looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.46.36.313-00.46.40.160 	there is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces of the people that pass by.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.48.24.963-00.48.28.465 	her manner is a little uncertain, a little tentative, but with a quiet determination beneath it.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.48.37.296-00.48.41.590 	her eyes are searching his face, but there is no expression on it except a cold and impassive one.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.54.21.374-00.54.25.318 	renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.27.711-00.56.34.672 	rick isn't listening to him.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.45.786-00.56.46.931 	at the linen stall, ilsa examines a tablecloth which an arab vendor is endeavoring to sell.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.56.51.133-00.56.52.468 	her manner is politely formal.

0003_CASABLANCA_01.22.39.849-01.22.43.088 	she is lost in his embrace.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.19.976-01.26.21.012 	rick sees carl attending to laszlo, who appears to be injured.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.28.30.809-01.28.34.840 	suddenly there is a crash at the door of the cafe, followed by the forced entry of several gendarmes.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.33.59.474-01.34.00.807 	ilsa and laszlo are both caught completely off guard.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.34.01.646-01.34.02.961 	horror is in ilsa's eyes.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.34.15.765-01.34.16.888 	in rick's hand is a gun, which he levels at renault.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.34.58.314-01.34.58.830 	strasser is on the phone.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.35.24.531-01.35.25.588 	the entire airport is surrounded by a heavy fog.

0003_CASABLANCA_01.35.29.057-01.35.29.927 	on the airfield a transport plane is being readied.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.39.52.819-01.39.55.352 	the door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly taxies down the field.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.40.14.313-01.40.19.701 	strasser stops in his tracks, looks at rick, and sees that he is armed.

0004_Charade_00.19.59.142-00.20.03.725 	reggie enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar.
0004_Charade_00.20.06.615-00.20.08.739 	he is a pale grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years.
0004_Charade_00.20.08.900-00.20.10.009 	sickly would be the word that describes him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking.
0004_Charade_00.20.19.303-00.20.21.192 	a small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk.
0004_Charade_00.23.03.037-00.23.06.058 	the glass is held over the first, magnifying the face.
0004_Charade_00.26.19.970-00.26.23.518 	punch and judy are arguing loudly.
0004_Charade_00.26.23.975-00.26.25.957 	punch and judy are batting each other on the head.
0004_Charade_00.26.41.791-00.26.44.463 	judy and the policeman are batting one another.
0004_Charade_00.27.12.619-00.27.15.339 	charles was mixed up in something terrible.
0004_Charade_00.27.23.793-00.27.25.308 	judy has gotten the upper hand is now batting the policeman's brains out.
0004_Charade_00.27.44.212-00.27.44.742 	reggie is dressed in a lovely givenchy dress.
0004_Charade_00.32.00.777-00.32.03.398 	reggie is too busy beating them out to do anything else.
0004_Charade_00.32.15.424-00.32.15.900 	she notices her hand is shaking.
0004_Charade_00.32.19.419-00.32.21.199 	suddenly the door opens and reggie shrieks -- but this time it is peter.
0004_Charade_00.33.24.274-00.33.26.817 	it is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together.
0004_Charade_00.34.52.582-00.34.54.427 	instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.
0004_Charade_00.34.57.135-00.35.04.076 	scobie sees where reggie is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.
0004_Charade_00.35.04.222-00.35.04.930 	the hand is starting to come down.
0004_Charade_00.36.09.916-00.36.12.469 	outside the window to reggie's room is a small, false balcony, consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand.
0004_Charade_00.36.14.187-00.36.15.806 	shooting straight down; there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump.
0004_Charade_00.36.18.392-00.36.18.758 	reggie's is the last such balcony on one side, but there are two or three on the other.
0004_Charade_00.36.22.488-00.36.23.238 	as it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short of touching it.
0004_Charade_00.37.05.987-00.37.08.811 	there is a light coming from this window, too.
0004_Charade_00.37.19.581-00.37.23.251 	inside the room are gideon, tex, and scobie in the midst of a heated discussion.
0004_Charade_00.39.12.528-00.39.14.304 	there is a knock at the door.
0004_Charade_00.39.25.737-00.39.27.316 	peter is silent for a moment.
0004_Charade_00.39.27.518-00.39.32.394 	she falls in his arms to be comforted.
0004_Charade_00.41.06.146-00.41.07.842 	reggie's back is turned to peter so he can't see her face.
0004_Charade_00.42.55.322-00.42.58.941 	reggie is on the phone.
0004_Charade_00.43.07.385-00.43.10.698 	he is silent for a moment, his face troubled.
0004_Charade_00.45.10.582-00.45.12.807 	bartholomew looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway.
0004_Charade_00.49.18.627-00.49.19.980 	reggie, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by dyle, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to dyle.
0004_Charade_00.49.20.124-00.49.20.523 	it is already occupied by a middle-aged.
0004_Charade_00.49.36.532-00.49.36.821 	now we see that the tourist, in turn, is following her.
0004_Charade_00.52.10.693-00.52.11.304 	they are all occupied except one and she looks inside it.
0004_Charade_00.52.48.252-00.52.50.544 	scobie looks around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall.
0004_Charade_00.52.56.679-00.53.01.007 	through the door, which scobie closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, leading up to a second floor.
0004_Charade_00.54.26.985-00.54.27.324 	dyle turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street.
0004_Charade_00.55.35.163-00.55.35.767 	then, to his amazement, dyle is lifted into the air and, unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of the roof.
0004_Charade_00.55.36.236-00.55.37.196 	working his arms between their two bodies, dyle suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his back as scobie's metal claw rips through both, a wound extending from the center of dyle's back to his shoulder.
0004_Charade_00.55.46.122-00.55.49.193 	the battle is going to scobie whose weight and strength are beginning to tire dyle, who is now on his back, trying to stop scobie from crawling over him.
0004_Charade_00.57.00.783-00.57.04.680 	there appears to be no sign of scobie.
0004_Charade_01.06.24.941-01.06.29.785 	reggie looks to where jean-louis is pointing -- to the top of the high armoire.
0004_Charade_01.06.41.358-01.06.43.738 	although she is still not high enough to see anything, by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly.
0004_Charade_01.06.56.810-01.06.58.523 	dyle is the first one to appear, coming out of gideon's room.
0004_Charade_01.07.02.699-01.07.03.890 	as dyle, tex and gideon enter, reggie is placing the little straight black chair to its original position.
0004_Charade_01.07.49.371-01.07.50.197 	dyle turns the key which is still in the door.
0004_Charade_01.07.58.507-01.07.59.491 	the room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no sign of scobie.
0004_Charade_01.07.59.634-01.08.02.383 	the sound of running water can be heard coming from behind the closed door to the bathroom and dyle is the first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under the door.
0004_Charade_01.08.05.946-01.08.06.984 	his face is distorted.
0004_Charade_01.08.43.010-01.08.45.354 	camera whirls for a tight close shot of a maid, her eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes her.
0004_Charade_01.12.37.850-01.12.40.940 	he sits down to take off his shoes, but is interrupted by the sound of reggie screaming.
0004_Charade_01.12.42.501-01.12.43.419 	he wheels as the door is slammed and reggie, who had been standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key.
0004_Charade_01.14.36.648-01.15.02.124 	close shot -- reggie on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her.
0004_Charade_01.18.16.932-01.18.24.955 	they walk back to the table, where a waiter is busy putting food on it, mostly on reggie's side.
0004_Charade_01.19.27.619-01.19.31.023 	on benches by the water's edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of mutual affection.
0004_Charade_01.19.34.021-01.19.36.569 	some are embarrassed, some are amused and some (the most intimate) damn annoyed.
0004_Charade_01.20.02.280-01.20.07.747 	she rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction is to look at her.
0004_Charade_01.21.31.299-01.21.32.110 	the cage is there.
0004_Charade_01.22.03.708-01.22.05.003 	the night porter is asleep behind the desk.
0004_Charade_01.22.12.281-01.22.14.132 	there is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek.
0004_Charade_01.22.23.004-01.22.23.174 	his body is sitting on the floor of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut.
0004_Charade_01.22.26.796-01.22.28.385 	he is now doubly apoplectic.
0004_Charade_01.26.39.560-01.26.40.065 	they are all wearing earphones.
0004_Charade_01.26.40.208-01.26.43.529 	the italian delegate is speaking.
0004_Charade_01.27.07.402-01.27.14.522 	it has been torn in half and scotch-taped back together.
0004_Charade_01.28.32.789-01.28.32.963 	inside the booth, reggie and adam can be seen heading for the door in a hurry.
0004_Charade_01.30.00.431-01.30.00.823 	between the curb and the jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up.
0004_Charade_01.30.38.935-01.30.39.908 	tex is startled.
0004_Charade_01.33.06.384-01.33.07.960 	but it isn't.
0004_Charade_01.36.43.010-01.36.47.176 	bartholomew, his face lathered for a shaving, is on the phone.
0004_Charade_01.37.43.483-01.37.45.585 	she presses the button, then notices it is in use.
0004_Charade_01.37.51.976-01.37.52.120 	inside is adam.
0004_Charade_01.38.13.889-01.38.15.730 	camera leading reggie as she runs -- the passageway is nearly empty.
0004_Charade_01.38.59.854-01.39.01.371 	suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across the tracks on the opposite platform is adam.
0004_Charade_01.39.09.962-01.39.11.359 	the approaching train can be heard.
0004_Charade_01.40.58.292-01.40.58.548 	there is, miraculously, no sign of reggie.
0004_Charade_01.42.13.114-01.42.16.266 	through the glass adam can be seen, leaving the sortie area.
0004_Charade_01.46.13.475-01.46.15.633 	but he is too late -- she is safely inside.
0004_Charade_01.46.26.355-01.46.28.249 	as the camera sweeps the magnificent old theatre -- boxes, seats, stage, but there is no sign of reggie.
0004_Charade_01.46.47.665-01.46.47.819 	inside, huddling down, is a terrified reggie, holding her breath as she watches him.
0004_Charade_01.46.53.030-01.46.53.151 	the stage is bathed in light.
0004_Charade_01.46.53.984-01.46.54.626 	adam is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage over his head -- and hearing them now.
0004_Charade_01.46.55.455-01.46.56.141 	he tries the knob -- the door is locked.
0004_Charade_01.47.48.199-01.47.58.599 	adam is listening carefully, trying to figure out where carson is standing, watching the ceiling.
0004_Charade_01.48.52.083-01.48.52.237 	it is marked c-4.
0004_Charade_01.49.26.651-01.49.32.766 	he is perspiring heavily.
0004_Charade_01.49.47.115-01.49.47.619 	carson is about to move closer to the prompter's box when suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through out of sight.
0005_Chinatown_00.05.46.704-00.05.49.721 	former mayor sam bagby is speaking.
0005_Chinatown_00.05.49.721-00.05.50.976 	behind him is a huge map, with overleafs and bold lettering.
0005_Chinatown_00.05.51.176-00.05.54.125 	some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while bagby is speaking.
0005_Chinatown_00.06.01.738-00.06.02.979 	an amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have been listening with keen interest.

0005_Chinatown_00.07.35.007-00.07.45.255 	suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced farmer drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep.
0005_Chinatown_00.08.09.489-00.08.09.889 	where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds.

0005_Chinatown_00.09.03.825-00.09.06.155 	he seems to be concentrating on it.
0005_Chinatown_00.10.12.150-00.10.13.052 	gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent.
0005_Chinatown_00.10.19.669-00.10.35.125 	gittes hesitates, then moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in order to be above mulwray.
0005_Chinatown_00.11.13.302-00.11.27.244 	he's in a puddle of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.
0005_Chinatown_00.12.18.105-00.12.19.898 	the cheap price tags are still on them.
0005_Chinatown_00.13.32.233-00.13.35.695 	they are a series outside a restaurant showing mulwray with another man whose appearance is striking.

0005_Chinatown_00.15.54.354-00.16.13.021 	gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose.
0005_Chinatown_00.16.23.868-00.16.25.368 	in the style of the hearst yellow press, there is a heart- shaped drawing around one of the photos that gittes had taken.

0005_Chinatown_00.17.16.491-00.17.17.325 	the customer is shrinking back into the chair.
0005_Chinatown_00.19.07.037-00.19.10.343 	gittes is staggered.
0005_Chinatown_00.20.36.171-00.20.41.674 	gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons and complaint.

0005_Chinatown_00.23.12.189-00.23.13.859 	there are a couple of other pictures of yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he's standing beside.
0005_Chinatown_00.23.47.995-00.23.53.994 	he goes out the door, nearly running into a man who is standing by the secretary's desk, about gittes' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper bag.
0005_Chinatown_00.26.00.253-00.26.02.824 	a chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored packard with a chamois.

0005_Chinatown_00.27.17.183-00.27.22.713 	the gardener nods, and is off, leaving gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.
0005_Chinatown_00.27.54.411-00.28.02.707 	he looks at the tool the gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.55.47.805-00.55.49.368 	he gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.55.53.267-00.55.55.703 	neff is hanging onto the railing.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.56.17.324-00.56.19.309 	she pulls the rug off the corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.57.19.876-00.57.24.485 	neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.12.344-00.58.13.942 	they are talking to each other.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.14.110-00.58.16.546 	their lips are seen moving but what they say is not heard.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.39.837-00.58.44.154 	in the kiss he is passive.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.59.06.182-00.59.06.818 	the cards are still in position.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.59.24.184-00.59.25.663 	fifteen or twenty cars are parked now.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.59.25.822-00.59.26.977 	charlie, the attendant has washed neff's car and is now polishing the glass and metal work.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.00.02.956-01.00.03.124 	there is a look of horror on his face now.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.00.48.827-01.00.49.681 	keyes is wearing his vest and hat, no coat.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.00.50.398-01.00.51.313 	he is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.33.173-01.01.34.921 	as keyes and neff enter, the door to norton's private office is opened.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.35.173-01.01.36.128 	from inside, mr. norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.36.232-01.01.37.134 	norton is about forty-five, very well groomed, rather pompous in manner.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.42.392-01.01.44.573 	naturally it is the best office in the building; modern but not modernistic, spacious, very well furnished; flowers, smoking stands, easy chairs, etc.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.02.50.343-01.02.51.338 	there is a charged pause.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.04.57.766-01.04.59.318 	neff is staring straight at phyllis.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.06.42.121-01.06.44.044 	there is a pregnant pause.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.08.09.350-01.08.09.770 	norton is watching him almost stupefied.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.09.10.184-01.09.11.167 	phyllis is on the phone.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.09.11.167-01.09.11.916 	she is not dressed as in norton's office.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.09.31.691-01.09.33.564 	he gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.09.50.667-01.09.50.972 	his hands are clasped behind his back.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.09.51.308-01.09.51.625 	there is a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.05.591-01.12.05.775 	the hallway is empty except for phyllis who has been standing close to the door of neff's apartment, listening.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.07.496-01.12.09.637 	keyes is coming out.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.52.573-01.13.52.796 	two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.53.257-01.13.53.745 	several visitors are waiting in chairs.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.53.821-01.13.54.502 	lola dietrichson is one of them.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.55.410-01.13.55.545 	her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.57.487-01.13.58.298 	lola sees him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the anteroom without recognizing her she stops him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.14.31.490-01.14.31.710 	lou schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his desk.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.16.43.701-01.16.50.130 	she turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.17.33.650-01.17.35.514 	in the foreground, neff and lola are having dinner.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.17.43.225-01.17.44.080 	neff is wearing a light summer suit, very much in contrast to lola's mourning.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.17.44.180-01.17.46.653 	apparently she is telling him a story and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.17.53.696-01.17.54.631 	he is only half listening to lola.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.02.427-01.18.10.417 	neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is walking toward keyes' office.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.13.128-01.18.13.815 	he is jackson, the man from the observation platform of the train.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.13.815-01.18.14.376 	he is wearing his stetson hat and smoking a cigar.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.14.376-01.18.14.864 	he is studying something in the file folder.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.25.704-01.18.28.638 	neff is just closing the door from the inside.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.18.28.839-01.18.30.227 	keyes, his coat off, is lying on his office couch, chewing on a cigar, as usual.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.20.19.724-01.20.20.662 	he indicates the cigar he himself is smoking.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.20.34.667-01.20.36.973 	jackson indicates the file folder he is holding.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.23.41.463-01.23.47.353 	neff is in the booth dialing a number, and as she waits he looks around to make sure he is not watched.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.24.10.011-01.24.14.542 	neff is moving slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.25.44.437-01.25.52.036 	phyllis takes his arm, forgetting where she is.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.27.19.379-01.27.22.484 	neff and lola are climbing over a low hill in the foreground.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.27.22.544-01.27.23.573 	the sky is starlit and music from the bowl comes over the scene from below (cesar franck d minor symphony).
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.27.49.351-01.27.49.510 	it is very dark and they are silhouetted against the shell lights.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.27.59.987-01.28.01.292 	she is crying.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.29.38.946-01.29.39.284 	a stream of office employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, among them neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.29.40.319-01.29.40.806 	he is stopped by keyes' voice, off to one side.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.29.41.581-01.29.43.222 	keyes is standing there buying cigars.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.29.43.802-01.29.55.785 	he is stuffing them into his pockets.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.30.39.397-01.30.46.003 	as he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.31.44.964-01.31.45.956 	he is deeply moved.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.51.817-01.32.53.836 	neff is entirely alone.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.00.910-01.34.01.905 	the gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.04.372-01.34.06.010 	the lights are turned on.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.06.583-01.34.07.722 	phyllis is coming down the stairs.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.07.908-01.34.09.463 	she wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right hand.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.09.496-01.34.15.674 	she reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes the catch so that the door can be opened from outside.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.17.997-01.34.25.255 	she moves towards the living room, where there is still light on.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.38.56.844-01.38.59.734 	phyllis is silent.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.39.24.822-01.39.26.429 	her expression is tortured.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.39.26.671-01.39.35.021 	neff goes on until he is close to her.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.27.389-01.40.31.364 	as she comes out of the kiss there is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.50.943-01.40.51.273 	only then is it apparent that phyllis' shot actually did hit him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.32.828-01.42.33.093 	the desk lamp is still lighted.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.33.429-01.42.34.788 	outside the windows, the dawn is slowly breaking.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.40.201-01.42.43.567 	neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.42.44.294-01.42.52.099 	he is very weak by now, and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.12.031-01.43.15.081 	suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.22.055-01.43.22.482 	the office door is wide open.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.43.22.667-01.43.23.364 	keyes is standing a few steps inside it.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.44.38.842-01.44.39.025 	his face is covered with sweat.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.44.39.185-01.44.39.546 	his shoulder is bleeding.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.44.39.908-01.44.40.499 	he is on the verge of collapse.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.45.39.328-01.45.40.257 	the sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.46.17.016-01.46.26.745 	then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and keyes walks slowly into the shot.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.47.10.927-01.47.16.063 	then with great difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is too weak.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.30.733-00.02.33.355 	in contrast to those about him, there is tension in godse's face, an air of danger in his movements.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.33.355-00.02.37.218 	he glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another tonga that pulls up just behind his.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.41.358-00.02.46.050 	sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little distance down the street an elderly man (prakash) with a short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.47.016-00.02.50.465 	there is just the slightest acknowledgment and then prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.54.743-00.02.56.261 	prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.50.465-00.02.55.571 	a fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.17.373-00.03.21.650 	the camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always godse's, but gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.29.240-00.03.31.172 	his breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.38.228-00.03.40.290 	he is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and manu half obscures him.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.54.064-00.03.56.859 	gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.16.841-00.04.17.239 	the huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.44.949-00.04.47.579 	commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony.
0011_Gandhi_00.07.10.088-00.07.12.684 	gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a manner.
0011_Gandhi_00.07.12.684-00.07.23.186 	he's taken out the ticket but there is a bit of bluster in his attitude and it is cut off by a cold rebuff from the european.
0011_Gandhi_00.07.26.725-00.07.27.629 	gandhi is nonplussed and beginning to feel a little less sure of himself.
0011_Gandhi_00.07.47.268-00.07.58.167 	gandhi is still puzzled by his belligerence, but is beginning to react to it, this time with a touch of irony.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.19.813-00.09.21.263 	we are in a large victorian parlor in a well-to-do home.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.21.814-00.09.23.200 	facing gandhi are khan, a tall, impressive indian.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.27.993-00.09.29.585 	it is said with a dignity and strength that makes the statement all the more bewildering.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.39.421-00.09.43.517 	we see mr. baker, a wealthy white lawyer, whose home this is, poking at the fire, slightly amused at gandhi's na vet.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.28.734-00.09.31.214 	gandhi is holding a british legal document; he lifts it pointedly.
0011_Gandhi_00.10.14.846-00.10.16.713 	he smiles, but his eyes show that it is no joke.
0011_Gandhi_00.10.44.017-00.10.46.812 	its tone is chilling, and gandhi's firmness is shaken a little.
0011_Gandhi_00.10.55.534-00.10.57.135 	the sturdy khan is studying him with a look of wry interest.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.25.433-00.11.28.046 	a wire basket has been placed on supports over the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.14.054-00.11.15.026 	near him, trying to be inconspicuous on the edge of the small crowd, are five policemen (one sergeant and four constables).
0011_Gandhi_00.11.15.026-00.11.16.396 	a horse-drawn paddy wagon is drawn up beside them.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.45.574-00.11.45.822 	she possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to do that which she would rather not.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.10.646-00.12.20.939 	it is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.20.939-00.12.22.661 	gandhi is unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder, but just as colorlessly.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.27.767-00.12.29.629 	three or four committed supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.35.303-00.12.36.877 	he glances nervously at ba, who is embarrassed for them both now.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.58.313-00.12.59.076 	at last gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.23.289-00.13.24.420 	it is the end of the speech.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.36.075-00.13.37.053 	he is facing the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.22.526-00.14.22.835 	gandhi is at the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.07.559-00.15.14.775 	the sergeant turns from the commotion to see that gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.31.090-00.15.31.972 	ba's anguished face is wet with tears.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.11.209-00.16.12.099 	ba is gently removing gandhi's suit coat, staring fearfully at a bandage on his head, another along the side of his face.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.12.099-00.16.13.726 	the room is gas lit, over furnished in the victorian manner.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.14.501-00.16.18.457 	gandhi sits carefully on the bed, where some newspapers are spread out, english-language ones among them.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.21.521-00.16.23.815 	before gandhi can retort there is a knock on the door.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.25.236-00.16.25.861 	they are all dressed in european suits, ties and stiff collars.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.58.010-00.17.01.143 	gandhi is stretching out on the bed, taking up another paper.
0011_Gandhi_00.17.14.277-00.17.14.820 	the three boys are there -- all bigger -- and ba holds a new addition; they all wave.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.40.249-00.18.43.001 	they are getting closer.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.51.796-00.18.53.340 	he starts forward again, he is almost on the youths -- clearly frightened, but.
0011_Gandhi_00.19.11.285-00.19.12.384 	a woman is leaning out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly.
0011_Gandhi_00.19.12.384-00.19.14.138 	it is the first youth's mother and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably.
0011_Gandhi_00.19.17.964-00.19.18.355 	a snickering response from the other youths -- but they are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of colin's mother's attitude.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.15.998-00.20.16.846 	sonja's tone is loaded with foreboding.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.37.851-00.20.39.904 	general smuts, whose presence is equal to his office, addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.48.986-00.20.50.665 	the reporter who stands opposite him is walker, much, much younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.17.039-00.21.17.501 	the gaze is firm, strong, cynical.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.20.894-00.21.21.189 	the sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.21.189-00.21.21.645 	this is where the magazine indian opinion is printed and we see stacks of it lying around.

0011_Gandhi_00.21.27.941-00.21.34.942 	gandhi and walker are approaching the tent from the river, gandhi discoursing earnestly.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.37.697-00.21.39.642 	this last remark has been directed toward charlie andrews, who sits near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.11.560-00.22.12.476 	reluctant as it is, it too carries commitment and walker senses it.

0011_Gandhi_00.23.41.266-00.23.42.200 	ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance to the building.
0011_Gandhi_00.23.46.607-00.23.47.694 	it is hushed, aware that walker might overhear them, but bristling with suppressed anger.
0011_Gandhi_00.24.17.956-00.24.19.749 	she says it derisively and it stings, but gandhi is aware of walker and he fights to hold his temper.
0011_Gandhi_00.24.36.260-00.24.40.007 	it is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the rear door, opening it to push her out as she struggles against him.
0011_Gandhi_00.25.07.538-00.25.10.057 	a moment, then she soothes the top of his head -- like the mother-wife she is.
0011_Gandhi_00.25.22.662-00.25.26.615 	gandhi sighs, putting his arms around her and she leans into him so that their heads are touching.

0011_Gandhi_00.25.56.467-00.25.57.783 	the mood is restless, belligerent.

0011_Gandhi_00.27.50.746-00.27.57.095 	the police half rise to look back at him, but there is a smattering of applause and several stand to look back.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.43.206-00.28.45.727 	this is the more sober gandhi they have come to know.
0011_Gandhi_00.28.46.477-00.28.52.627 	there is a tentative reaction from the audience, but uncertain.

0011_Gandhi_00.34.29.860-00.34.30.069 	it is a command, and angry in its own way, but it carries all the weight of his influence on them.

0011_Gandhi_00.36.14.493-00.36.20.875 	but it is a line that winds through masses of prisoners, some with bowls, eating, some not yet in the line.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.25.357-00.36.26.130 	as gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large barrels of soup, he sees that khan is serving from one of them.

0011_Gandhi_00.37.16.018-00.37.21.475 	he is distracted by a phalanx of guards (an officer and four men) pushing their way through the prisoners.
0011_Gandhi_00.37.24.869-00.37.25.371 	the prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who gandhi is.

0011_Gandhi_00.46.37.252-00.46.39.546 	gokhale is pleased, gandhi amused.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.52.267-00.46.54.077 	it is brusque but affectionate; we know he regards charlie as gandhi does.
0011_Gandhi_00.47.26.288-00.47.27.266 	this is private -- beautiful and still.
0011_Gandhi_00.48.12.374-00.48.15.850 	when he speaks his voice is thick with feeling.
0011_Gandhi_00.48.31.453-00.48.34.039 	his eyes are watery with emotion, but he stares at gandhi rigidly.
0011_Gandhi_00.50.00.355-00.50.07.042 	gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach.
0011_Gandhi_00.51.06.224-00.51.10.227 	the sun is high and the train is stopped by the river.
0011_Gandhi_00.50.59.368-00.51.01.134 	across the river down from the third class coaches a small group of indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes.

0011_Gandhi_00.51.26.155-00.51.27.977 	the clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on another.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.34.420-00.54.35.898 	gandhi is leaning out of a window in a third class coach.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.36.178-00.54.38.106 	ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.15.354-00.54.17.206 	as they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.17.206-00.54.26.416 	a small troop of cavalry are coming slowly along the line of gandhi's train toward them.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.39.167-00.54.40.993 	they are british and their troop leader is viciously angry.

0011_Gandhi_00.54.41.238-00.54.42.628 	gandhi and charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, hanging on through the door, and both enjoying it immensely.
0011_Gandhi_00.55.24.070-00.55.27.615 	the camera has been moving in; now it jumps to jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience.
0011_Gandhi_00.55.06.422-00.55.10.748 	he is chairing the congress.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.06.485-00.56.07.558 	he is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for jinnah.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.41.552-00.56.48.176 	he is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of jinnah's major speech has dissipated.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.56.160-00.56.57.001 	this is the first time we have seen them.
0011_Gandhi_00.57.43.836-00.57.45.220 	and now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too.
0011_Gandhi_00.57.51.670-00.57.53.358 	jinnah too is listening now -- aloofly, challengingly.
0011_Gandhi_00.58.50.152-00.58.54.144 	a cameraman flashes a picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here and there, tepidly.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.01.463-00.59.04.790 	nehru, who has been looking at gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to patel.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.16.719-00.59.17.859 	nehru is looking a little harassed, from the ragging he is taking and from the ride.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.17.859-00.59.19.427 	the ashram is only half-finished, the ground unworked, the buildings only partially completed and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.19.427-00.59.20.639 	they are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is tethered right across the path.
0011_Gandhi_01.00.02.270-01.00.03.438 	nehru and his friends are sprawled out around him.
0011_Gandhi_01.00.34.463-01.00.39.510 	his smile is sardonic, but genuine, theirs embarrassed and self-conscious.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.05.468-01.01.06.655 	he re-directs nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, but he keeps right on talking.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.57.259-01.01.59.921 	the goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.17.740-01.02.19.580 	clothes are dipped in the brownish water.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.22.159-01.02.22.786 	it is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.22.786-01.02.23.051 	but they are laughing at their task.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.58.826-01.03.01.537 	the fingers are thin, half-starved, like the man himself.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.52.771-01.02.53.894 	his voice is choked and near to tears, resonant with the unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like him.
0011_Gandhi_01.02.59.179-01.03.01.897 	he looks at gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying desperately not to show it.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.12.846-01.03.21.546 	the camera is low, shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.36.760-01.03.38.604 	from its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.31.998-01.03.33.444 	the sergeant is on the low sloping roof of the station.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.48.467-01.03.49.322 	the whole of the obscurely lit platform is covered thick with waiting crowds.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.49.322-01.03.50.746 	they engulf the station house, back and front, and on the other side of the train more people are packed all along its length, and beyond them along the narrow street that stretches through the little collection of houses adjoining the station, every rooftop is covered -- men, women with babes in arms, children.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.30.995-01.04.33.665 	as he advances, the crowd parts -- it is almost eerily silent.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.41.325-01.04.42.766 	as their clothes indicate, the area is muslim, so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to gandhi as he moves through them.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.42.766-01.04.43.105 	most of the faces are gaunt and lean.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.33.665-01.04.38.285 	and suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on the concrete platform, and the english captain shoves his way through to confront gandhi down the little aisle that was being made for him.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.51.276-01.04.53.340 	there is a flicker of recognition, but uncertain.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.01.397-01.05.04.379 	it has the cold assurance of a lawyer, and the captain is a little shaken by it.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.07.361-01.05.12.199 	he tries to make it severe, but it is a comedown.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.12.199-01.05.16.105 	it is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it that the captain doesn't like, but gandhi's unrelenting stare unnerves him.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.26.274-01.05.26.986 	where all was silence before there is now the hum of excitement.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.53.000-01.05.54.920 	it is the kind of listening that opens the heart.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.54.920-01.05.56.033 	behind him a mass of villagers sits stoically, outside the dwelling, waiting while their case is heard.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.56.699-01.06.00.328 	and finally meha's wife, sitting near ba, the two women listening together but meha's wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead and hardly combed, her sari dirty.
0011_Gandhi_01.06.45.560-01.06.46.357 	the words are said bleakly, not to raise false hopes.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.46.391-01.07.48.683 	a ball is hit.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.52.113-01.07.53.504 	the batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then.

0011_Gandhi_01.10.28.165-01.10.29.925 	charlie is stunned, and obviously hurt.
0011_Gandhi_01.11.39.108-01.11.41.099 	it is packed to overflowing; restless.

0011_Gandhi_01.12.30.031-01.12.32.759 	the courtroom is silent, but we can still hear the sound of the chanting outside.
0011_Gandhi_01.12.48.749-01.12.52.033 	the magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too aware of the mob outside.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.30.226-01.13.32.370 	the journalists are scribbling furiously.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.57.309-01.13.58.434 	as he smiles down at them, he is turned by.
0011_Gandhi_01.14.12.147-01.14.13.536 	again gandhi is surprised -- but even more cautious.
0011_Gandhi_01.14.58.501-01.14.59.675 	the governor, sir edward gait -- the portrait of the king prominent behind him -- is feeling as cornered as sir george but for different reasons.

0011_Gandhi_01.14.59.672-01.15.00.522 	but even so the governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly.
0011_Gandhi_01.15.08.628-01.15.11.631 	sir george is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling but defensive.
0011_Gandhi_01.16.01.117-01.16.03.428 	the secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him.
0011_Gandhi_01.16.15.260-01.16.16.426 	sir edward is at the liquor cabinet.
0011_Gandhi_01.17.45.560-01.17.45.860 	all the others have been dressed in european clothes.
0011_Gandhi_01.18.22.403-01.18.24.616 	of them all, nehru's manner is the most naturally patrician and jinnah watches him with a somewhat envious awareness of it.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.43.173-01.19.44.084 	patel is the first to recognize the implications.
0011_Gandhi_01.22.24.551-01.22.34.283 	gandhi, in prison clothes, is led along a small corridor to a room.
0011_Gandhi_01.22.20.510-01.22.24.551 	the door is held open by a prison guard.
0011_Gandhi_01.22.54.959-01.22.57.899 	nehru's face is a map of concern, but he manages a small smile of greeting.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.36.189-01.25.38.443 	he is traveling slowly, steadily in an armored car at the head of fifty armed sepoys -- gurkhas and baluchis -- immaculate, precise, awesome.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.41.852-01.25.43.978 	it is a relentless, determined procession, filling the dusty street with a sense of menace and foreboding.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.20.849-01.25.22.398 	a large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform at one side of the park.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.22.398-01.25.22.765 	it is political, but the crowd is mixed.
0011_Gandhi_01.26.39.753-01.26.42.011 	he issues his commands in a quiet and unemotional voice, as though they were on maneuvers.
0011_Gandhi_01.28.37.758-01.28.39.246 	a group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, some disappearing, a few heroic individuals astride the wall reaching down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below.
0011_Gandhi_01.28.39.246-01.28.41.377 	dyer glances woodenly at the panel -- a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise.
0011_Gandhi_01.30.36.995-01.30.38.504 	for the first time there is the hint of uncertainty in his manner.
0011_Gandhi_01.30.39.380-01.30.40.022 	there is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.15.699-01.31.16.488 	the camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.16.488-01.31.18.141 	we are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.21.620-01.31.22.986 	he is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly, desolately.
0011_Gandhi_01.34.52.091-01.34.54.071 	chelmsford is pacing along one side of a large conference table.
0011_Gandhi_01.35.12.038-01.35.15.122 	this time gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader.
0011_Gandhi_01.35.19.052-01.35.30.822 	it is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry.
0011_Gandhi_01.35.36.396-01.35.40.860 	the british are stunned almost to speechlessness -- the audacity, the impossibility of it -- and from gandhi of all people.
0011_Gandhi_01.35.40.860-01.35.42.986 	the senior civil servant, kinnoch, is the first to recover.
0011_Gandhi_01.36.08.432-01.36.10.076 	chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, and he strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.23.096-01.37.23.387 	the top is lifted, whiskey pours.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.23.581-01.37.24.116 	we are still in the council room, but time has passed.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.24.116-01.37.24.796 	the indian delegation has gone, and the british are relaxing as a servant pours.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.35.599-01.37.40.312 	there are some smiles, but not all of them are quite so amused.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.48.007-01.37.49.298 	it is an instruction they all find correct.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.53.832-01.37.54.882 	we are featuring two british soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering torch light that reveals their tense wariness.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.55.303-01.37.56.353 	a huge crowd is gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- and their mood is confident, belligerent.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.58.402-01.37.58.822 	desai, gandhi's new male secretary, is with them.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.19.223-01.38.27.129 	but it is ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.27.129-01.38.30.678 	it is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.30.678-01.38.38.313 	there is applause and noise, but ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind gandhi, who is talking with patel and nehru.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.41.672-01.38.47.924 	in close shot we see other british soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting.
0011_Gandhi_01.39.33.425-01.39.38.040 	neither of these goals is easy, and the audience reaction shows it.
0011_Gandhi_01.40.30.440-01.40.32.150 	there is an excited stir; he silences it.
0011_Gandhi_01.40.49.354-01.40.54.160 	as suitcoats, shirts, vests, trousers, are flung into a pile.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.30.104-01.41.32.424 	despite the indian tunic he now wears he cannot help but look and act like the incisive, patrician lawyer he is under the skin.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.33.747-01.41.35.233 	kallenbach is smiling too.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.45.024-01.41.45.148 	he is carrying a baby wrapped in rags.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.50.009-01.41.52.141 	they turn back to the train and just as they do, the tall indian woman in the red sari tips a porter, taking one small bag from him and turns: mirabehn (madeleine slade) is tall, quite pretty and extremely english despite the sari.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.10.392-01.43.11.231 	the camera is on a row of sandals by the door -- patel's, azad's, desai's, gandhi's.
0011_Gandhi_01.42.35.564-01.42.40.307 	gandhi is carding fiber to thread as they talk.
0011_Gandhi_01.43.16.988-01.43.22.318 	mirabehn, seated like the others, is almost in the circle, sitting near ba, and listening like her.
0011_Gandhi_01.44.41.022-01.44.42.640 	ba is spinning.
0011_Gandhi_01.44.47.358-01.44.47.949 	it is the beginning of an enduring friendship.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.12.187-01.45.13.844 	there are enough of them in their group to be watching the marchers with a challenging disdain.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.13.794-01.45.16.675 	the marchers are men in loin- clothes and tunics; they brandish torn and ripped english cloth and shout in unison.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.34.184-01.45.35.324 	a few of the tail-enders watching, some running clear of the police, some being beaten.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.27.659-01.47.30.052 	patel leans with one arm on a table, his mood as devastated as gandhi's; he is looking at an indian paper on the table by his hand.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.30.052-01.47.30.853 	it is a new york times and we just glimpse the picture of the severed head lying in the smoldering ashes.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.40.322-01.47.42.626 	jinnah as usual in a finely cut european suit, the others are dressed in tunics of homespun as they will be to the end.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.59.911-01.48.01.773 	azad keeps his eyes fixed on gandhi, sensing, fearing what is going to happen.
0011_Gandhi_01.48.16.117-01.48.18.927 	gandhi is listening, but still withdrawn into himself.
0011_Gandhi_01.48.54.283-01.48.54.603 	and nehru ignores the thought too, because like azad his mind is already on the real danger.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.41.466-01.49.43.481 	mirabehn reaches the doorway and is suddenly brought up.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.45.372-01.49.46.666 	she is holding him as he heaves in a spasm of dry retching, his face to the wall.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.41.375-01.49.45.691 	when he is finished, he lies almost limp in her arms and she gently lowers him to the mat.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.47.281-01.49.48.871 	she is not yet devotee and nurse.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.48.724-01.50.58.067 	when he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them.
0011_Gandhi_01.51.52.720-01.52.04.342 	she bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear.
0011_Gandhi_01.53.04.271-01.53.05.065 	kallenbach and desai are a step or two behind him.
0011_Gandhi_01.53.05.065-01.53.07.363 	it is a victory.
0011_Gandhi_01.54.04.580-01.54.05.206 	a little boy is pulling a goat by a tether.
0011_Gandhi_01.54.09.015-01.54.10.854 	gandhi is walking, holding ba's shoulder for support with one hand, and mirabehn's with the other.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.54.690-01.55.56.647 	the judge is flipping through documents on the case, a troubled frown on his face.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.49.190-01.56.54.583 	the advocate general is speaking from a folded journal.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.13.400-01.57.14.912 	there is a little shock of reaction around the courtroom.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.30.043-01.57.30.989 	it is almost a cruel challenge to the obviously humane broomfield.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.53.212-01.57.54.586 	he looks up at gandhi and his own respect for him is almost poignantly manifest.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.34.452-01.58.38.742 	he stands, staring at broomfield, and now it is his face that shows the respect.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.57.012-01.58.59.078 	he is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees.
0011_Gandhi_01.59.17.940-01.59.18.433 	they are staring off at the car.
0011_Gandhi_01.59.05.790-01.59.06.096 	the car is an early 1930s morris minor.
0011_Gandhi_01.59.59.014-02.00.00.581 	he is looking straight ahead.
0011_Gandhi_02.00.06.281-02.00.12.079 	another angle featuring walker and collins, who are sitting alone, in the cool shadows of the temple, watching with fascination as gandhi and ba repeat their marriage ceremony for them, walker jotting notes occasionally, but his eyes always glued to gandhi and ba, who are in part lost in memories and echoes of a significance only they can know.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.00.127-02.01.04.203 	ba takes the last step, so that they are face to face.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.52.958-02.04.07.409 	featuring gandhi staring out to sea, his mind locked in reflection, and suddenly his head lifts, his eyes become alert, he is caught by some excitement which he weighs for a moment, then he stands, his manner suddenly tingling with optimism.
0011_Gandhi_02.02.35.867-02.02.38.984 	walker stares at him, then at what gandhi seems to be looking at.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.50.708-02.03.53.047 	but there is no mistaking the sudden glow in gandhi's face.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.21.366-02.04.22.452 	he is looking in astonishment at his principal secretary.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.28.698-02.04.30.220 	his adc, a general, a brigadier, a senior police officer are with him.
0011_Gandhi_02.04.30.220-02.04.31.083 	like him they hold the same offices, but are a new team.
0011_Gandhi_02.05.15.424-02.05.21.722 	a moment as irwin considers it, then it is the general who speaks.
0011_Gandhi_02.05.45.981-02.05.47.119 	he is concerned enough to be angry, but certain enough to be dogmatic.
0011_Gandhi_02.06.25.984-02.06.28.118 	and suddenly a mass of people, hidden by the embankment, appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river, and the camera lifts slightly with their movement and we see that they are but the forerunners of a long tendril of humanity that stretches across the river, all the way back to the distant outskirts of the city.
0011_Gandhi_02.06.17.024-02.06.20.957 	and around the ashram many fires are burning, people are cooking breakfast, some are packing knapsacks for the journey, others are strewing the path from the ashram with leaves.
0011_Gandhi_02.06.55.874-02.06.56.912 	gandhi grins, looking at mirabehn, who is massaging his legs.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.40.828-02.07.43.613 	featuring gandhi and walker, pyarelal just behind them all glancing ahead at the police, who are now quite near.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.51.788-02.07.52.609 	walker smiles -- a little uneasily -- for they are now near the police.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.52.556-02.07.55.371 	walker is turning, watching for a move from the police but begins to grasp that there may be none.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.24.729-02.08.27.523 	both sides of the track are lined with peasants holding flower petals and leaves, all gazing expectantly down the road.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.27.523-02.08.29.618 	behind them the village is strung with the green, white and saffron colors of independence.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.37.964-02.08.41.468 	two large policemen stand arms-akimbo at the front of them all, their postures imposing and threatening, though the impression is somewhat weakened by the children skirting around them.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.51.135-02.08.52.538 	he is wiping sweat from his face.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.17.849-02.11.21.419 	the general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, irwin's adc and the principal secretary are all present.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.21.419-02.11.23.728 	the two men who ran the projector are quietly dismantling it.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.41.149-02.11.43.425 	for the first time he is truly angry.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.56.714-02.12.01.732 	men, women and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.21.871-02.12.24.617 	nehru is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.24.617-02.12.26.283 	the truck is loaded with boxes that contain salt packets and nehru and eight or nine others are selling them to people who flock about the truck.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.31.013-02.12.33.774 	mounted indian police are coming down either side of the street, a wave of foot police running forward down the center.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.44.387-02.12.46.295 	nehru is grabbed, and hurled so that he half falls, half leaps to the street.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.46.295-02.12.47.739 	one of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.49.001-02.12.51.301 	he is young and vigorous and he swivels on the ground as though to strike back.
0011_Gandhi_02.12.53.459-02.12.54.220 	and a lathi is brought smashing across the side of nehru's head.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.01.511-02.14.09.278 	the senior police officer is brought up by the chill directness of it.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.17.772-02.15.20.029 	walker is off to one side, climbing to stand in the back of collin's car.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.32.505-02.14.32.725 	there are two other reporters near them.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.23.840-02.15.24.998 	we see mirabehn and some indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed.
0011_Gandhi_02.20.19.517-02.20.22.058 	irwin is in shadows behind his desk looking, still, in some kind of shock, staring at gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.20.57.005-02.21.05.124 	gandhi, mirabehn and gandhi's secretary, desai, waving goodbye from the boat deck of their ship as it sails -- mirabehn is holding the tether of a goat -- all of them smiling at the camera like voyagers everywhere.
0011_Gandhi_02.21.16.387-02.21.26.465 	gandhi on the steps of kingsley hall in the east end of london being greeted by a cheering crowd.
0011_Gandhi_02.21.55.195-02.21.59.251 	a gavel is struck and ramsay macdonald begins his opening address.
0011_Gandhi_02.23.20.244-02.23.21.289 	he is in his white suit, the black-ribboned pince-nez.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.44.023-02.24.45.342 	gandhi is moving with the stream of passengers disembarking from the third class section.
0011_Gandhi_02.24.45.342-02.24.47.084 	ba and mirabehn are struggling along behind him, desai and pyarelal completing the little group.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.30.763-02.25.35.434 	the camera tracks across the platform and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying ba.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.35.434-02.25.41.016 	and the camera tracks again and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying mirabehn.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.45.561-02.25.48.434 	it is driven by an american lieutenant and his passenger is a woman dressed in an american war correspondent's uniform (margaret bourke-white).
0011_Gandhi_02.26.19.739-02.26.21.061 	gandhi sits by the window that is grilled rather than barred.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.21.061-02.26.23.944 	he is spinning in a shaft of light -- and looking off -- as we hear a camera click and the rustle of movement.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.23.944-02.26.25.025 	his hair, only half-gray in london, is now white.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.26.098-02.26.30.880 	bourke-white -- who has been moving, crouching to shoot him and the light -- sags back against the wall, relaxing at last.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.51.780-02.26.55.061 	bourke-white bursts into an appreciative radiance -- already she has assessed him, and been won.
0011_Gandhi_02.26.55.061-02.27.00.311 	gandhi walks along, bourke-white loping along beside him, a little distance away, listening, but searching too for an angle, a moment that is right.
0011_Gandhi_02.28.02.373-02.28.03.775 	gandhi is at the wheel and he is smiling off at bourke-white, who is trying ineptly to imitate him on another spinning wheel.
0011_Gandhi_02.28.03.775-02.28.05.542 	the garden they are in has gone to seed a bit, but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful.
0011_Gandhi_02.29.43.911-02.29.44.962 	his tone is not altogether patient.
0011_Gandhi_02.30.44.781-02.30.46.083 	the implication is it was a long time ago.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.14.535-02.31.14.701 	two military ambulances are drawn up nearby.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.18.298-02.31.19.941 	he is almost at the bottom when a british army doctor starts to go up them.
0011_Gandhi_02.31.47.943-02.31.49.348 	azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her.
0011_Gandhi_02.33.48.020-02.33.53.066 	a moment, and he lifts it slowly, his face confirming for us what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.06.653-02.34.13.252 	his posture is utterly unchanged, ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily at the floor in front of him, but suddenly tears begin to run down his cheeks.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.21.549-02.34.24.017 	and slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft.
0011_Gandhi_02.35.27.368-02.35.29.617 	it is cut off by the sound of a door being opened, close.
0011_Gandhi_02.35.37.304-02.35.40.720 	it is a break in their independence conference, and as he lights a cigarette, a weary gandhi approaches him with azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.35.40.720-02.35.43.152 	jinnah's anger is clearly too deep to be left at the conference table.
0011_Gandhi_02.35.52.204-02.35.56.318 	nehru and patel are approaching from the conference room, both of them looking worn and angry too.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.24.378-02.36.26.857 	gandhi is staring at jinnah trying to fathom the source of his anger and fear.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.36.279-02.36.37.178 	he turns to see that mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.43.496-02.36.45.467 	gandhi is last through the door.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.19.051-02.37.19.911 	it is his presence that has silenced them.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.29.326-02.37.31.906 	gandhi is rising from the floor, where his spinning wheel sits.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.25.629-02.37.26.814 	mirabehn is spinning across the room.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.33.684-02.37.40.950 	gandhi's two grand nieces, manu and abha, who help mirabehn now that ba is gone, rise quickly at mirabehn's signal, manu to help with his shawl, abha to hold his sandals so that he can slip into them.
0011_Gandhi_02.37.55.990-02.38.00.795 	gandhi is approaching with nehru and azad, pyarelal trails close behind.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.36.756-02.38.38.669 	they are all awed, timid even in his actual presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.08.008-02.38.09.970 	in the back seat we see two men, one of whom is prakash (the bearded man at gandhi's assassination).
0011_Gandhi_02.39.30.213-02.39.31.171 	jinnah is on the small balcony of this elaborate room.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.31.171-02.39.31.306 	he is looking down in a slightly supercilious manner.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.31.306-02.39.31.558 	as usual he is impeccably dressed.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.23.558-02.39.26.909 	he has been looking at gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.26.909-02.39.27.709 	nehru, patel and azad are on the same side of the room as gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.39.48.243-02.39.49.755 	his vanity is too great not to be touched by that prospect.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.08.925-02.40.12.351 	he measures gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere, and when he is satisfied with that, he turns slowly to nehru, patel and azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.16.834-02.40.19.402 	they have all been taken by surprise by the offer -- and do not feel what gandhi feels.
0011_Gandhi_02.41.42.053-02.41.47.074 	a band plays the indian national anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the green, white and saffron flag of india is raised on the flagpole.
0011_Gandhi_02.41.49.750-02.41.51.914 	a band plays the new pakistani national anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the white, green with white crescent, flag of pakistan is raised on the flagpole.
0011_Gandhi_02.42.10.406-02.42.19.335 	the little flagpole is empty, the rope dangling, flapping loosely down the pole.
0011_Gandhi_02.42.25.327-02.42.27.188 	but apart from that, he is alone; the whole ashram seems deserted.
0011_Gandhi_02.44.42.295-02.44.47.168 	patel and azad are there and pyarelal of course, and with them now the giant figure of abdul ghaffar khan, the first time we have seen him among gandhi's intimate group.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.06.521-02.45.10.441 	it is an empty and despairing echo of gandhi's words.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.37.009-02.45.38.143 	he is moving toward the door.
0011_Gandhi_02.46.13.588-02.46.18.063 	there are fires, the sounds of spasmodic gunfire, of looting, screams, the roar of police vehicles and occasional sirens.
0011_Gandhi_02.46.20.867-02.46.22.817 	outside one of the houses is a car, an army jeep, policemen, a few soldiers and a group of people.
0011_Gandhi_02.46.48.122-02.46.49.930 	azad, tahib, a muslim whose house this is, mirabehn and pyarelal are with him along abdul ghaffar khan.
0011_Gandhi_02.47.09.980-02.47.14.486 	a surging gang of youths, many carrying torches, and far outnumbering the little group of police and soldiers, are shouting up at the roof.
0011_Gandhi_02.47.19.450-02.47.21.371 	it is a comment too grave for glibness, and gandhi is obviously struck by the pain of it.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.12.833-02.48.13.974 	nehru lowers his head again; it is like another burden on a man who already has too many.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.30.147-02.48.31.043 	the sounds of rioting and looting on nearby streets, but here a mass of people are gathered.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.32.383-02.48.32.903 	it runs up the side of the building and is lined with waiting people.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.22.599-02.48.29.951 	he is writing, pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.36.061-02.48.37.931 	they are whispering quietly, but mirabehn has stopped on seeing nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.47.992-02.48.49.764 	nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at gandhi's eyeline.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.49.764-02.48.51.968 	gandhi must take his eyes from his writing to look, and he is almost moved to tears at the sight of nehru.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.56.959-02.48.58.400 	patel sits near the head of the cot so the three of them are on a level.
0011_Gandhi_02.49.41.594-02.49.45.237 	outside the canopied area, bourke-white is crouched, her camera framing the three of them.
0011_Gandhi_02.49.57.105-02.50.04.377 	he glances at patel, and we see that they recognize that their bland conviction that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply misplaced.
0011_Gandhi_02.50.25.385-02.50.31.296 	patel, mirabehn, azad, bourke-white are gripped by the same realization.
0011_Gandhi_02.50.32.355-02.50.35.099 	an outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual crowd, grown even larger now, and more women among them.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.03.565-02.52.04.698 	on the cover is a picture of rioting men fighting and diagonally a cut-out of gandhi lying on his cot.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.05.171-02.52.06.110 	mirabehn is rising, leaving the magazine at her feet.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.11.490-02.52.12.721 	the doctor, who is testing gandhi's pulse yet again, glances at him -- no encouragement -- and moves away.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.12.721-02.52.26.535 	nehru moves to the side of the cot and gandhi smiles weakly and holds out a hand, but he is in pain.
0011_Gandhi_02.52.55.865-02.52.59.473 	gandhi smiles whimsically, he touches him again but there is no change in his attitude.
0011_Gandhi_02.53.33.565-02.53.38.656 	a huge crowd, some smoke in distant buildings, some damage near to help us know this is still calcutta, and all is not yet at peace.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.25.369-02.54.26.612 	there are five men facing gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.27.294-02.54.28.315 	there are thongs around their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even more powerful.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.29.076-02.54.29.843 	their clothes are dirty -- and they are too -- but they are laying knives and guns at gandhi's feet.
0011_Gandhi_02.54.42.554-02.54.47.142 	gandhi is looking at him, testing, not giving or accepting anything that is mere gesture.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.10.773-02.55.13.613 	nahari's face is knotted in emotion, half anger, half almost a child's fear -- but there is a wild menace in that instability.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.18.724-02.55.20.114 	it is as though the man has told him of some terrible self- inflicted wound.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.49.909-02.55.57.662 	he is sobbing, but in his anger it seems almost as though he means to kill gandhi in retaliation.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.48.787-02.55.52.541 	nahari sneers, but there is just a flicker of desperate curiosity.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.54.377-02.55.58.681 	his face almost cracks -- it is a chink of light, but it does not illumine his darkness.
0011_Gandhi_02.57.08.402-02.57.12.836 	trucks with riot squads (shields and truncheons) in place, but they are lounging, waiting.
0011_Gandhi_02.57.12.836-02.57.15.724 	there is silence, and air of somnolence.
0011_Gandhi_02.58.07.501-02.58.11.754 	nearer gandhi, behind mirabehn, are nehru, patel, azad and pyarelal.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.45.263-02.59.47.465 	he is not fully recovered, but well on the way.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.49.948-02.59.51.656 	we get a wide-angle shot now and see that bourke-white is shooting one of her favorite subjects again.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.51.656-02.59.55.374 	she is enjoying the banter, as is mirabehn, who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and patel, who sits cross-legged like gandhi on the floor.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.55.374-02.59.56.969 	pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.56.086-02.59.58.203 	abha is sitting next to manu, looking at a collection of pictures of gandhi, obviously bourke-white's.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.40.662-03.00.44.041 	she is photographing his getting-up and leaning on the two girls.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.16.201-03.01.19.398 	we see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften.
0011_Gandhi_03.02.03.625-03.02.05.963 	gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on manu, the other on abha.
0011_Gandhi_03.02.25.191-03.02.33.493 	godse is making the pranam to him and he suddenly, wildly draws his gun and fires.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.13.19.154-00.13.23.498 	all the lights are out, save the blue glow of a television coming from one of the downstairs rooms.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.14.43.748-00.14.43.996 	one of the voices is familiar.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.15.02.796-00.15.07.310 	we can see this is a nice place as harry crosses the entry hall to a doorway, the flickering light of the television emitting from inside the room.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.15.08.418-00.15.11.558 	on the tube, dave is interviewing actor martin weir when suddenly the screen goes black and the desk lamp comes on.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.15.27.259-00.15.29.155 	harry stares back, trying to figure out who this guy is.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.28.03.476-00.28.13.290 	there are some of karen, harry with a much younger, blonde karen.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.28.55.877-00.28.58.377 	harry is tugging the string to lower the blinds behind the desk.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.33.40.677-00.33.47.117 	chili's minivan is parked outfront.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.40.09.619-00.40.09.837 	he gets out of the car and heads for the set where harry is now looking up at the sky and yelling at someone.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.47.12.611-00.47.14.484 	yayo, now soaked with sweat, is still here.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.47.28.075-00.47.29.075 	we tilt down to her ankle, hmmm, is that a bulge?.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.51.22.688-00.51.28.949 	chili steps inside, checks some of them out: most of the photographs are of martin.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.51.37.750-00.51.42.025 	martin is checking out karen, nodding.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.55.29.271-00.55.34.771 	karen is thoroughly enjoying chili's manipulation of martin.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.55.29.574-00.55.34.574 	karen is starting to enjoy chili's handling of martin.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.56.45.249-00.56.50.749 	martin is leaning forward.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.58.21.188-00.58.31.959 	bo catlett and harry are laughing as harry, very drunk now finishes another drink.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.59.26.822-00.59.29.822 	chili checks out the bar, sees they aren't there, then looks up at the railing.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.00.47.714-01.00.51.730 	even karen is looking at him differently now as they slide into the booth with a now shocked, rapidly sobering harry.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.09.58.289-01.10.01.184 	now there's a big guy in a plaid wool shirt next to him, the same guy we saw when bo catlett was here.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.14.43.507-01.14.54.533 	problem is, the sun's setting, so there's no glare at all.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.14.55.190-01.15.05.876 	bo catlett is behind a big wooden desk on the phone.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.15.12.495-01.15.15.893 	we can now see that one of the latinos is older, the other two, younger, are his bodyguards.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.18.03.015-01.18.09.641 	harry can't speak; his jaw is broken.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.22.23.777-01.22.25.398 	both of his eyes are black.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.22.25.398-01.22.25.771 	his face is swollen and purple.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.25.32.841-01.25.34.598 	chili's minivan is parked out front.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.25.48.137-01.25.56.813 	all eyes are on harry as they're led to a table.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.36.24.110-01.36.25.394 	chili sits down on the sofa again; he can't believe how easy this is gonna be.
0013_Halloween_00.03.23.116-00.03.23.670 	he is a handsome young man underneath.
0013_Halloween_00.04.01.568-00.04.06.132 	quickly the door is opened and the pov moves inside.
0013_Halloween_00.04.15.124-00.04.16.748 	the drawer is opened.
0013_Halloween_00.04.16.748-00.04.18.679 	a large butcher knife is withdrawn.
0013_Halloween_00.05.38.634-00.05.43.773 	then suddenly the pov is covered by the mask and we see through the eye-holes.
0013_Halloween_00.05.52.007-00.05.54.190 	she is still completely nude.
0013_Halloween_00.06.05.274-00.06.09.130 	there is a rapid blur as the pov drives the butcher knife into the sister's chest and out again almost before we've seen it.
0013_Halloween_00.07.52.388-00.07.54.255 	next to her in the passenger seat is sam loomis, a clinical psychiatrist.
0013_Halloween_00.07.59.649-00.08.00.181 	he is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through pages in a manila folder.
0013_Halloween_00.09.36.444-00.09.48.381 	standing by the side of the road is a male patient, a wild- looking man in his sixties dressed in a white gown, who stares at the station wagon.
0013_Halloween_00.16.31.418-00.16.33.774 	the shape and the station wagon are gone.
0013_Halloween_00.18.59.802-00.19.01.766 	loomis is inside on the telephone.
0013_Halloween_00.21.49.250-00.21.50.338 	the shape isn't visible behind the windshield.
0013_Halloween_00.21.55.031-00.21.55.735 	there is a quick glimpse of him, a strange pale face staring back.
0013_Halloween_00.21.55.735-00.21.56.279 	the shape is close to camera, out of focus.
0013_Halloween_00.23.51.339-00.23.53.160 	up the sidewalk is a series of bushes lining the street.
0013_Halloween_00.23.56.331-00.23.57.206 	there, partially hidden in the shadows of a bush, is the shape of a man, watching them.
0013_Halloween_00.23.57.206-00.23.57.732 	he is barely visible, almost blending in with the dark foliage.
0013_Halloween_00.23.57.732-00.23.58.636 	the shape is gone.
0013_Halloween_00.25.27.065-00.25.28.426 	it is lee brackett, annie's father.
0013_Halloween_00.25.28.426-00.25.29.683 	he is a tall man in a county sheriff's uniform.
0013_Halloween_00.26.18.198-00.26.23.712 	several children in costumes are going door to door collecting their treats.
0013_Halloween_00.28.37.234-00.28.40.809 	the sun is a pale glow behind the trees.
0013_Halloween_00.30.50.910-00.30.53.603 	the headstone is missing, uprooted from the ground.
0013_Halloween_00.32.13.321-00.32.16.821 	following behind is the station wagon.
0013_Halloween_00.32.17.216-00.32.18.448 	two police cars are parked in the street in front of nichols hardware store.
0013_Halloween_00.35.12.555-00.35.13.083 	we are in the front seat of the station wagon.
0013_Halloween_00.36.34.522-00.36.36.594 	the are sounds of wind and chirping crickets.
0013_Halloween_00.36.59.330-00.37.01.026 	it is totally dark in the house.
0013_Halloween_00.38.08.323-00.38.11.394 	loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting.
0013_Halloween_00.42.03.609-00.42.05.525 	there is a dining room and living room with a big bay window that looks out into the street.
0013_Halloween_00.42.05.878-00.42.06.974 	it is a large home with a staircase that leads to the bedrooms upstairs.
0013_Halloween_00.43.37.167-00.43.37.653 	annie is startled by the crash.
0013_Halloween_00.44.13.341-00.44.15.488 	next to him are lester's legs, kicking and struggling a few feet above the ground.
0013_Halloween_00.44.15.488-00.44.16.312 	off screen, the shape is strangling the dog in mid-air.
0013_Halloween_00.44.50.749-00.44.54.205 	laurie and tommy are sitting on the couch watching the horror- thon on tv.
0013_Halloween_00.45.57.781-00.45.59.573 	she is wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed.
0013_Halloween_00.47.46.477-00.47.46.951 	the shape is gone.
0013_Halloween_00.50.18.739-00.50.20.539 	lindsey is back watching the tv horror-thon.
0013_Halloween_00.55.29.667-00.55.36.076 	the figure of a man carries what seems to be a body across the wallace's back yard.
0013_Halloween_00.56.44.998-00.56.46.663 	suddenly, there are noises from the street.
0013_Halloween_00.57.23.968-00.57.25.416 	standing there is brackett.
0013_Halloween_00.59.18.074-00.59.18.572 	the lights are all out.
0013_Halloween_00.59.50.907-00.59.52.626 	the living room is empty.
0013_Halloween_00.59.52.626-00.59.55.425 	the lights are off.
0013_Halloween_01.00.36.799-01.00.38.401 	the house is totally black inside.
0013_Halloween_01.00.42.083-01.00.43.947 	as it gets closer, we see that laurie is carrying a jack-o-lantern, with a candle illuminating from the center of the pumpkin.
0013_Halloween_01.00.43.947-01.00.45.364 	behind laurie is lyndsey and tommy making scary noises.

0020_Raising_Arizona_01.02.35.209-01.02.37.336 	hi is looking at him evenly.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.02.44.511-01.02.46.262 	hi is suddenly nervous and urgent.
0020_Raising_Arizona_01.03.24.216-01.03.28.470 	hi's face is set in rigid dismay.

0020_Raising_Arizona_01.08.41.011-01.08.43.604 	the cashier is already down on the floor, out of frame.

0020_Raising_Arizona_01.16.59.886-01.17.02.484 	hi and ed are already peeling out.

0020_Raising_Arizona_01.27.53.299-01.27.54.067 	both are still dyed blue.

0021_Rear_Window_00.04.20.145-00.04.22.032 	while jeff is continuing his phone conversation, we see the object of his look.
0021_Rear_Window_00.04.22.033-00.04.22.133 	there is almost a touch of eagerness in his expression.
0021_Rear_Window_00.04.24.502-00.04.26.223 	they are smiling and talking, although we cannot hear their dialogue.
0021_Rear_Window_00.05.05.492-00.05.08.818 	jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.05.08.818-00.05.08.941 	the camera is now focused on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan.
0021_Rear_Window_00.05.08.941-00.05.09.808 	loud ballet music is pouring from her open window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.05.10.088-00.05.13.256 	she now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby.
0021_Rear_Window_00.05.42.956-00.05.43.848 	she is a faded, refined type.
0021_Rear_Window_00.06.00.652-00.06.02.062 	it is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song.

0021_Rear_Window_00.06.26.506-00.06.26.982 	his shirt is stained with sweat underneath.
0021_Rear_Window_00.06.37.460-00.06.38.559 	near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill.
0021_Rear_Window_00.06.58.862-00.06.59.210 	for a moment he is hidden by the wall.
0021_Rear_Window_00.06.59.593-00.07.00.097 	jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself.
0021_Rear_Window_00.07.30.493-00.07.32.002 	as he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.07.34.826-00.07.35.178 	he is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie.
0021_Rear_Window_00.07.39.573-00.07.40.115 	they are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias.
0021_Rear_Window_00.07.40.058-00.07.41.500 	jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest.
0021_Rear_Window_00.07.43.577-00.07.44.308 	her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.22.927-00.08.23.032 	jeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.34.115-00.08.35.078 	she is a husky, unhandsome, dark- haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath the coat.
0021_Rear_Window_00.08.39.526-00.08.39.709 	it is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse.
0021_Rear_Window_00.10.58.584-00.10.59.011 	the camera is very low at one end of the divan.
0021_Rear_Window_00.10.59.011-00.10.59.154 	jeff's head, half-buried in the sheet, is large in the fore-ground.

0021_Rear_Window_00.14.23.496-00.14.24.950 	dreamily, and methodically, she is brushing her long copper- colored hair.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.23.496-00.14.24.698 	she is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.24.921-00.14.27.050 	his eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.27.255-00.14.28.240 	a shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.27.640-00.14.31.132 	having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.28.287-00.14.28.706 	he is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.36.307-00.14.36.700 	the boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat.
0021_Rear_Window_00.14.52.927-00.14.54.092 	quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.04.162-00.15.04.262 	for a moment, both are lost from sight.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.06.474-00.15.10.226 	when they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms, over the threshold.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.27.094-00.15.31.864 	he releases her hands, goes to the window and pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.33.712-00.15.34.153 	there is a soft, understanding look on jeff's face, and he gives an involuntary sigh.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.32.500-00.15.34.132 	he is unaware that stella is now standing behind him.
0021_Rear_Window_00.15.40.558-00.16.00.943 	the camera makes a short sweep around the neighborhood showing that some of the rooms are now with their lights on.

0021_Rear_Window_00.16.15.958-00.16.20.160 	the screen is filled with the eyes, nose and mouth of a woman coming nearer and nearer to the camera to kiss jeff.
0021_Rear_Window_00.16.27.371-00.16.28.284 	the face is more or less in shadow, a faint light coming onto the profile from the window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.16.55.289-00.16.56.675 	she turns on the second lamp and the light shows us that her beauty is not alone in her face.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.02.730-00.17.03.761 	she is now full figure, beautifully groomed and flawless.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.03.675-00.17.03.775 	her dress is high-style fashion and dramatic evening wear.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.31.184-00.17.32.298 	she looks down at the long mahogany table beside her which is littered with a number of his personal effects.
0021_Rear_Window_00.17.31.798-00.17.31.898 	her own handbag is also on the table.

0021_Rear_Window_00.20.59.194-00.21.01.246 	jeff's opinion of that is a short chuckle.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.28.873-00.21.32.321 	he holds this attitude for just a moment, then seems to shake off his concern to lift his head and turn his attention to what might be happening in his neighborhood beyond his window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.31.779-00.21.34.550 	her apartment is below that of the salesman with the invalid wife.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.37.509-00.21.39.438 	jeff's attention is concentrated on an apartment we have not seen before.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.38.556-00.21.39.879 	at the moment, she is putting on her make-up in front of the bedroom mirror.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.42.839-00.21.43.839 	she is quite flat-chested, and the dress hangs unattractively.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.59.082-00.22.00.639 	a nearer view show us a more intimate picture of the woman jeff is concentrating on.
0021_Rear_Window_00.21.59.944-00.22.00.529 	a small, candle-lit table is set up, with dinner for two.
0021_Rear_Window_00.22.00.639-00.22.01.383 	she is thin and unattractive.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.32.302-00.23.32.602 	he is unaware that lisa is standing behind him, and is also watching this little drama.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.32.609-00.23.32.769 	in the background, lisa, having just placed a pair of candlesticks on the table, is returning to the kitchen.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.49.418-00.23.51.418 	the kitchen-lining room combination of the ballet dancer's apartment has now been made more presentable.

0021_Rear_Window_00.23.50.617-00.23.55.088 	the ice box is now skillfully concealed by a large chinese screen.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.50.769-00.23.53.436 	she is the perfect hostess, animated, charming, and with an added personal touch for each guest.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.51.282-00.23.54.001 	her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men -- one wearing black tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a long island socialite -- a young rather handsome, actor in grey flannel suit -- and last, a bright, pleasant, young man who might possibly be from wall street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.51.436-00.23.54.282 	she is behaving with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first saw her in the morning.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.53.567-00.23.57.769 	miss torso is now wearing a cocktail dress, which shows off her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of hors d' oeuvres.
0021_Rear_Window_00.23.53.682-00.23.55.067 	all kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by more attractive effects, and lamp light softens the surroundings.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.15.618-00.24.18.681 	the latter two are engaged in an animated conversation.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.16.630-00.24.19.722 	she turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek, as if she's telling him to be patient.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.21.753-00.24.25.491 	she turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.43.202-00.24.47.093 	the camera moves in until jeff is in semi-closeup, alone.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.47.024-00.24.50.506 	there is a slight, but warm, smile on jeff's face as he looks at the drawn shade.
0021_Rear_Window_00.24.53.162-00.25.01.475 	the salesman has prepared a dinner tray, and is carrying it from the kitchen, through the living room, into the bedroom.
0021_Rear_Window_00.25.20.369-00.25.22.034 	the wife is grudging beginning to eat the dinner.
0021_Rear_Window_00.25.32.990-00.25.38.358 	and instantly there is a marked change in his attitude.
0021_Rear_Window_00.25.35.439-00.25.39.519 	we get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made.
0021_Rear_Window_00.25.35.858-00.25.41.013 	he relaxes, smiles, is warm.
0021_Rear_Window_00.25.58.907-00.26.04.253 	his face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.05.239-00.26.10.566 	she is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.15.760-00.26.19.269 	through the studio window of the song-writer's apartment we see the man at work again on his original melody, and he is farther along the line of the melody than before.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.24.720-00.26.28.240 	lisa is emerging from the kitchen, carrying the serving dish of their lobster thermidor.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.43.753-00.26.44.753 	shooting over jeff's shoulder we see beyond him the divan- bed upon which lisa is stretched out.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.50.400-00.26.52.863 	a faint shade of disappointment is seen on lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table.
0021_Rear_Window_00.26.51.334-00.26.52.334 	there is one light burning, behind lisa's head.
0021_Rear_Window_00.27.10.600-00.27.11.600 	we now observe that two small lit candles adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out.
0021_Rear_Window_00.27.14.195-00.27.16.792 	a fierce discussion is in progress.
0021_Rear_Window_00.28.10.567-00.28.11.520 	jeff is definitely angry.
0021_Rear_Window_00.28.17.630-00.28.18.630 	lisa realizes she is getting nowhere.
0021_Rear_Window_00.31.02.352-00.31.04.381 	jeff tries to be pleasant, and offhand.
0021_Rear_Window_00.38.56.130-00.38.56.630 	the back of his chair is to the window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.02.422-00.39.04.922 	he quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.05.136-00.39.08.185 	the salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.12.985-00.39.13.085 	they are both in shadow.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.34.173-00.39.41.673 	jeff, with a restraining hand to stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.40.863-00.39.45.221 	the camera pans down and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.41.673-00.39.44.173 	the camera moves forward, and as it reaches the edge of the window, pans down and shows us what the salesman is looking at.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.44.173-00.39.46.173 	the little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.49.835-00.39.50.335 	the old lady is wearing a faded house-robe.
0021_Rear_Window_00.39.52.335-00.39.54.609 	jeff is amused at the dog incident.
0021_Rear_Window_00.40.01.843-00.40.04.843 	he is carefully wiping out the interior with dust cloth.
0021_Rear_Window_00.40.31.279-00.40.42.922 	as stella goes out the door, the camera moves in until jeff's head, and the binoculars, are filling the screen.
0021_Rear_Window_00.40.50.448-00.40.54.814 	he is in the act of placing it on the floor.
0021_Rear_Window_00.41.10.088-00.41.13.588 	the man is now moving out of the living room, and the binoculars pan him though to the small kitchen which is seen through a side window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.41.13.588-00.41.14.588 	the man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory.
0021_Rear_Window_00.41.15.088-00.41.18.088 	jeff lowers the binoculars and there is an expression of exasperation on his face.
0021_Rear_Window_00.42.20.986-00.42.21.486 	through the view-finder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen.
0021_Rear_Window_00.42.21.486-00.42.21.686 	his back is still to us.
0021_Rear_Window_00.42.39.786-00.42.40.186 	for a moment he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room.
0021_Rear_Window_00.42.45.286-00.42.45.386 	half of a man's body is now seen in the living room.
0021_Rear_Window_00.42.45.386-00.42.45.886 	he is not carrying anything.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.09.862-00.43.11.862 	he is dressed only in bathing trunks, and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.18.582-00.43.22.082 	decides they are no good, and returns to his carpet sweeping.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.32.857-00.43.33.357 	there are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the bedroom, but the living room and the kitchen are lighted.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.35.357-00.43.36.357 	he is in the act of laying out the mattress.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.35.357-00.43.35.857 	his wife is slightly younger, peroxided, faded show girl type.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.35.357-00.43.36.857 	also wearing pajamas, with a fluffy handkerchief in the left pocket, the wife is leaning over the railing holding onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the floor of the courtyard.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.36.357-00.43.36.857 	the man is balding, and middle-aged.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.36.857-00.43.38.857 	having been a one-time siffleuse, her call to the dog is clarion and melodic.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.36.857-00.43.37.357 	he is wearing striped pajamas.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.47.757-00.43.50.757 	she is in the bathroom brushing her long hair, while her thoughts seem to be far away.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.53.257-00.43.55.757 	she is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.54.257-00.43.55.257 	she wears a short smock, although her legs are still bare.
0021_Rear_Window_00.43.54.757-00.43.55.257 	it takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved.
0021_Rear_Window_00.44.06.757-00.44.07.757 	her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks.
0021_Rear_Window_00.44.09.165-00.44.10.165 	by her position, lisa is seated on jeff's sound knee, her arms around his neck.
0021_Rear_Window_00.45.48.165-00.45.50.665 	however, her expression is disturbed as she watches jeff.
0021_Rear_Window_00.45.50.665-00.45.51.165 	we are now able to see that jeff's apartment is in darkness, only faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.45.50.666-00.45.52.166 	jeff is thoughtful for a moment, then he relaxes and smiles a little.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.00.403-00.46.02.403 	she is reading a book held in one hand, while eating a sandwich in another.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.00.403-00.46.00.903 	miss torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.00.903-00.46.01.403 	the only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.01.403-00.46.02.403 	her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.08.843-00.46.10.343 	lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what jeff is referring to.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.22.333-00.46.23.833 	he is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new fullness and melody.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.22.833-00.46.23.833 	although it is not complete, it is farther along then before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.24.333-00.46.24.833 	jeff is staring out of the window again.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.33.286-00.46.35.786 	at last the salesman is seen coming along the corridor.
0021_Rear_Window_00.46.35.786-00.46.36.286 	slung over one shoulder, with his arm through is, is a large coil of sturdy rope.
0021_Rear_Window_00.47.00.629-00.47.02.129 	in a sudden surprise move, she swings his chair completely around so that his back is to the window.
0021_Rear_Window_00.48.57.850-00.49.01.850 	she is still staring out the window, as the scene.
0021_Rear_Window_00.49.33.503-00.49.35.503 	we see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him.
0021_Rear_Window_00.49.35.703-00.49.36.703 	jeff is seated in the dark, his face lit by the faint glow from the distant street.
0021_Rear_Window_00.49.36.503-00.49.37.003 	he is looking out of the window tensely, as the camera moves in, until he is in big profile.
0021_Rear_Window_00.49.36.503-00.49.37.003 	from jeff's viewpoint, all the windows are dark.
0021_Rear_Window_00.49.36.903-00.49.37.003 	the salesman's apartment is dark as well.
0021_Rear_Window_00.49.40.603-00.49.40.803 	the camera is now facing jeff.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.06.374-00.50.09.182 	jeff is still looking toward the salesman's apartment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.20.929-00.50.24.429 	when is dies out, we see just the glow of the cigar burning.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.21.346-00.50.24.846 	all we can see is the glow of the salesman's cigar.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.27.254-00.50.27.754 	jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.27.754-00.50.28.254 	he is talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.28.348-00.50.29.848 	she is carrying a tray with breakfast on it.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.31.112-00.50.33.848 	there is a touch of urgency in his voice.
0021_Rear_Window_00.50.37.561-00.50.43.970 	stella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is across jeff's lap.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.17.994-00.51.23.994 	jeff is just lifting a piece of bacon to his lips when stella speaks.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.27.950-00.51.28.801 	again the bacon stops before is reaches jeff's mouth.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.37.702-00.51.40.702 	we are now aware that the salesman is now in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, because the smoke from a newly lighted cigar is starting to ascend toward the ceiling of his room.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.40.595-00.51.43.095 	jeff's eyes, over the coffee cup, are staring intently at the backyard.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.52.846-00.51.55.846 	miss torso, in ballet outfit, is hanging up a small wash on a clothes line.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.53.346-00.51.55.846 	she is doing her inevitable leg practice at the same time.
0021_Rear_Window_00.51.56.530-00.51.57.030 	jeff seems to be getting a bit listless, or bored, by constantly watching thorwald's apartment.
0021_Rear_Window_00.52.05.830-00.52.06.830 	he is wearing only his pajama bottoms, because of the heat, and we see that he is a well-muscled, attractive young man.

0021_Rear_Window_00.53.00.533-00.53.03.071 	she is already going up the steps.
0021_Rear_Window_00.53.30.755-00.53.31.255 	the binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing and blowing stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway.
0021_Rear_Window_00.53.30.755-00.53.31.255 	by the time the binoculars are up, another truck has crossed from the left.
0021_Rear_Window_00.53.31.755-00.53.35.255 	and by her attitude we can see that there is no truck outside.
0021_Rear_Window_00.53.34.838-00.53.35.338 	the figure of stella is seen, looking up toward jeff's apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture.
0021_Rear_Window_00.53.42.482-00.53.43.482 	shooting towards the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer.
0021_Rear_Window_00.53.42.982-00.53.43.306 	the second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars.

0021_Rear_Window_00.54.55.803-00.54.56.712 	he is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective.

0021_Rear_Window_00.57.09.491-00.57.14.097 	startled at being observed, doyle moves quickly away from the window, affecting nonchalance.
0021_Rear_Window_01.00.53.666-01.00.54.666 	the camera is concentrating on the long-focus lens camera which fills the screen.
0021_Rear_Window_01.00.54.666-01.00.55.166 	just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich.
0021_Rear_Window_01.00.59.283-01.01.00.090 	jeff is sober.
0021_Rear_Window_01.00.59.308-01.00.59.908 	(except for a small light in the kitchen, jeff's apartment is in darkness.)

0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.03.29.934-03.03.30.340 	bilbo is extremely old and frail.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.03.30.340-03.03.31.127 	he is dozing.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.04.20.326-03.04.37.539 	as bilbo looks up, he is stung by the beauty before him.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.04.47.504-03.04.49.130 	elrond, celeborn and galadriel are waiting for them.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.04.51.269-03.04.55.337 	the lighting is beautiful.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.05.35.043-03.05.36.842 	galadriel is watching him.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.05.50.637-03.05.54.222 	gandalf kneels before sam, merry and pippin -- who are all looking tearful.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.05.54.222-03.05.57.711 	there is great sadness.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.06.30.082-03.06.34.854 	frodo is downcast.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.07.11.969-03.07.17.963 	frodo is holding bilbo's red journal out towards him.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.07.23.578-03.07.26.649 	sam is sobbing.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.07.26.649-03.07.28.822 	merry and pippin are distraught.
0025_THE_LORD_OF_THE_RINGS_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_KING_03.10.16.484-03.10.26.436 	sam in growing darkness, still follows the departing ship with his eyes, merry and pippin are already preparing to leave.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.01.11.678-00.01.14.496 	the beast isn't worried.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.01.41.409-00.01.43.957 	in every gesture, edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.02.15.052-00.02.23.746 	while the other boys are rapt with attention, will looks bored.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.02.34.551-00.02.36.700 	edward is chatting up will's pretty date to the homecoming dance.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.02.36.700-00.02.37.971 	she is enjoying the story, but also the force of edward's charisma.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.02.39.716-00.02.40.786 	will, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.03.07.385-00.03.08.764 	she couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.04.19.924-00.04.21.971 	both men are a little drunk.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.05.56.664-00.06.01.447 	we look down at the river, where edward's reflection is caught in the dark water.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.07.38.597-00.07.39.920 	as it keeps ringing, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.07.41.094-00.07.43.106 	a cradle is still in its carton.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.08.00.913-00.08.03.054 	this won't be good news.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.08.28.867-00.08.29.771 	hours later, and the lights are dimmed.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.08.29.771-00.08.30.687 	most of the passengers are asleep, including josephine.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.08.30.687-00.08.32.277 	her head is propped against will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.08.34.359-00.08.41.231 	off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.08.41.231-00.08.50.973 	the kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.09.03.886-00.09.06.567 	edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in earshot.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.09.27.953-00.09.29.518 	the night is whirring and breathing, alive.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.10.53.267-00.10.54.283 	truth be told, edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.11.25.437-00.11.28.693 	the doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.11.35.506-00.11.39.853 	she looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.12.04.727-00.12.07.303 	we rush in on zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.14.38.321-00.14.39.998 	the wall is filled with family photos, happier times.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.14.39.998-00.14.42.408 	most of the pictures are of will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.15.12.846-00.15.14.402 	the illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.15.14.402-00.15.15.738 	there are no i.v.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.18.53.724-00.18.58.572 	where an eight-year old will is propped up in bed, his face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.19.19.090-00.19.20.832 	his voice is high and thin, but he gives it his all.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.20.19.905-00.20.21.424 	although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first real exposure to grown-up edward, who we'll follow from roughly the ages of 18 to 30.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.20.41.457-00.20.46.360 	as the crowd goes wild for edward, don price is the only teammate who doesn't mob him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.21.48.777-00.21.49.986 	it's roughly the shape of man, but no human could be that large.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.23.58.577-00.23.59.508 	just how big is this guy.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.04.932-00.24.05.710 	karl the giant is bigger than any man you've ever seen.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.11.202-00.24.11.665 	what remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.36.238-00.24.38.014 	edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.39.541-00.24.42.273 	after a beat, edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.25.11.738-00.25.14.254 	karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.26.19.404-00.26.26.917 	spirits buoyed by the high school marching band, all the good citizens of ashton are gathered to see off edward and karl.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.27.30.033-00.27.32.891 	only don price, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see edward go.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.27.08.240-00.27.09.316 	the ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.27.52.184-00.27.56.325 	the old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.35.575-00.28.42.111 	the road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.42.111-00.28.44.419 	the sun is still shining, and the birds still chirping.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.52.718-00.28.53.506 	the forest is dead quiet.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.29.58.891-00.30.01.052 	one is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.01.052-00.30.04.809 	even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.39.964-00.30.43.254 	everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.54.328-00.30.55.578 	most are smiling.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.55.578-00.30.56.316 	what's more, all of these people are barefoot.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.32.06.192-00.32.18.396 	he and beamen are joined by norther winslow (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.32.41.724-00.32.43.963 	young jenny is stealthily untying the laces on edward's shoes.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.33.30.645-00.33.37.848 	the gathered citizens of spectre cheer for edward, who is confused and overwhelmed.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.35.50.122-00.35.52.327 	edward looks to the bank, where young jenny hill is watching him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.36.47.028-00.37.02.759 	lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold fiddlers.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.37.02.759-00.37.15.784 	the whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, edward bloom.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.39.59.400-00.40.02.786 	the trees ahead are moving.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.02.786-00.40.08.372 	at first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood cracking and groaning, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.14.648-00.40.15.829 	now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of lightning.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.30.889-00.40.35.124 	he screams up at the night, until his breath is gone.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.35.813-00.40.36.250 	another lightning flash, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.36.250-00.40.41.159 	edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.43.06.097-00.43.10.295 	josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed?
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.45.31.158-00.45.32.674 	around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.46.09.899-00.46.11.070 	we are where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment in an alabama field.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.47.07.535-00.47.11.408 	he may only be four feet tall, but amos has a titanic presence.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.18.764-00.48.19.686 	that foot is massive.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.21.735-00.48.23.232 	from a very low angle, we look up to see just how massive he is.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.48.614-00.48.54.821 	he points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.49.09.321-00.49.13.472 	angle on colossus, realizing the gig is up.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.50.34.980-00.50.53.831 	only edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and closer to this woman.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.50.57.389-00.51.02.361 	the crowd becomes a blur, and the young woman is lost in its wake.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.51.15.397-00.51.16.768 	colossus is thumbing for a ride.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.53.56.266-00.53.58.913 	he points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.55.01.040-00.55.02.415 	his head is tilted to the side, and as we pull back, we see why: he's holding it in a massive lion's open mouth.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.55.02.415-00.55.03.662 	the beast's sharp teeth are just poking his skin.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.55.03.662-00.55.05.002 	if the lion so much as flinches, edward is dead.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.55.35.321-00.55.37.858 	amos is walking past.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.56.10.454-00.56.14.262 	but all he can think about is.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.56.29.316-00.56.32.830 	a sudden explosion as edward is shot out of a giant cannon.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.56.51.625-00.57.08.601 	under a full moon, edward walks up to the battered camper, and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.57.23.225-00.57.25.257 	it seems to be stuck.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.57.28.066-00.57.30.184 	edward is knocked down by a massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.00.29.971-01.00.32.986 	it's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative dress of the passing students, it could be any era.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.00.53.454-01.00.54.948 	finally, a decision is reached.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.01.36.455-01.01.37.763 	all she can finally think of to say is.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.02.21.272-01.02.23.834 	edward is dumbstruck.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.03.22.371-01.03.25.492 	sandra isn't paying a lot of attention.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.05.19.822-01.05.21.760 	the same image of don's dead face on the tile is reflected in the eye.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.05.24.702-01.05.30.587 	edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.05.30.587-01.05.32.384 	don is about to slug edward again when he turns.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.05.35.886-01.05.43.677 	edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.06.45.649-01.06.51.932 	the door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.07.49.553-01.07.54.625 	the noise of the engines is deafening, but edward is engrossed in an asian phrasebook.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.08.40.259-01.08.43.786 	a chinese ventriloquist is on stage with his communist puppet.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.08.43.786-01.08.58.630 	we have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.09.14.601-01.09.15.364 	we look down with edward, who is drifting right for the stage.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.09.37.832-01.09.39.957 	her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.09.39.957-01.09.41.770 	the soldiers are on their feet, whistling and hollering.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.09.41.770-01.09.44.426 	up on the catwalk, edward is surprised by an enemy soldier.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.12.23.769-01.12.26.061 	pretending to be her bitchy sister.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.13.10.743-01.13.13.496 	even ping is a little affected.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.14.18.106-01.14.18.963 	she knows it can't be him.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.14.25.856-01.14.37.271 	she gasps, disbelieving, but his hand is real.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.14.57.366-01.15.02.869 	a beat, then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.15.05.083-01.15.06.145 	will is watching her.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.17.10.326-01.17.15.917 	edward is startled.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.20.50.503-01.20.51.698 	will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.21.04.928-01.21.09.421 	the storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, frankensteinian lawnmowers.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.23.50.592-01.23.52.393 	the man is none other than.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.25.05.449-01.25.05.736 	the teller woman is already waving him to the back.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.25.23.728-01.25.26.569 	the teller woman is crying as she works the combination.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.27.41.327-01.27.43.846 	sandra is watering the garden.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.28.07.047-01.28.08.285 	edward's eyes are closed.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.28.40.545-01.28.46.087 	her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.31.47.761-01.31.49.532 	jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.32.34.161-01.32.40.029 	it's late, and edward is pensive.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.33.03.700-01.33.08.798 	it's like being caught in a waterfall.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.33.20.448-01.33.21.622 	the world is close and echoing, because the car is underwater.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.33.21.622-01.33.22.834 	the tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is water.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.33.24.485-01.33.26.636 	water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.36.17.056-01.36.19.694 	the sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.36.33.253-01.36.38.750 	the inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.38.22.965-01.38.25.555 	finally realizing who this woman is.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.40.19.128-01.40.22.298 	in every detail it is impossibly charming.
0026_The_Big_Fish_01.40.33.261-01.40.35.876 	edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer.

0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.35.15.810-01.35.32.574 	walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from the back seat.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.36.59.436-01.37.01.234 	he is looking off as the car slows.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.37.04.835-01.37.05.039 	the dude looks where walter is looking.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.37.09.530-01.37.14.859 	both are gaping off at the front lawn.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.39.02.217-01.39.03.671 	he is crossing to lebowski.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.40.33.801-01.40.38.543 	quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is restrained by o'brien.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.42.29.403-01.42.33.738 	donny is visibly frightened.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.42.42.290-01.42.45.002 	walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on dieter's.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.42.45.669-01.42.49.832 	the dude is digging into his pocket.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.43.17.349-01.43.17.709 	watching dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.43.27.047-01.43.27.482 	his jaw is still clamped on dieter's ear.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.45.13.155-01.45.17.505 	he is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk to whomever wants to take it.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.46.29.637-01.46.32.256 	it is a high, wind-swept bluff.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.46.37.575-01.46.45.616 	walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic lid.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.48.10.974-01.48.13.606 	walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.
0027_The_Big_Lebowski_01.48.39.309-01.48.41.010 	the dude is near tears.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.04.58.075-00.04.59.128 	a gun is put to his head.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.06.12.655-00.06.16.383 	he is smoking a cigarette.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.06.16.383-00.06.20.837 	his movements are slow and somewhat innocent.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.06.53.183-00.06.55.228 	jody is motionless under the black hood.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.07.16.697-00.07.17.742 	all the men are drinking tea.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.07.29.309-00.07.33.741 	fergus is sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.08.38.772-00.08.40.452 	she is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, screaming.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.10.16.023-00.10.31.751 	fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.11.20.307-00.11.21.062 	she is carrying a pot of tea and two cups.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.11.24.002-00.11.24.296 	it is sweltering now in the greenhouse.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.11.24.863-00.11.25.987 	the hood is drenched with sweat.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.14.06.790-00.14.08.495 	jody isn't smiling anymore.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.16.14.052-00.16.15.617 	it is of jody, in cricket whites, smiling, holding a bat.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.21.46.253-00.21.51.265 	suddenly the hood is slammed back over his head.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.22.17.247-00.22.18.804 	maguire is sitting where he sat before, stock-still.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.29.46.807-00.29.48.163 	fergus is moved.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.30.38.642-00.30.40.140 	maguire is there, with another.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.34.40.958-00.34.43.521 	fergus is silent; his eyes wet.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.35.12.430-00.35.17.023 	fergus takes jody, whose hands are still tied behind his back, by the elbow.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.36.27.209-00.36.29.917 	fergus is all cold and businesslike.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.36.59.080-00.37.02.327 	jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands, then freeing them, he is off like a hare.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.37.07.671-00.37.14.367 	fergus gains on him--stretches his arm out--but jody sprints ahead again--as if he has been playing with him.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.39.35.865-00.39.36.540 	it is fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.39.36.540-00.39.37.319 	he is knocking the bricks from an outer wall.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.40.28.736-00.40.30.488 	some distance down the street is a sign -- millie's unisex hair.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.43.34.952-00.43.37.218 	fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.43.20.655-00.43.23.303 	she stares at the mirror, staring at fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.44.45.389-00.44.46.870 	he is sweating.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.45.02.675-00.45.03.435 	the street is dilapidated, full of squats.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.46.01.455-00.46.02.823 	we see tristram deveroux, a young sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.46.02.823-00.46.04.295 	beside him is franknum, the cockney foreman.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.46.19.827-00.46.21.874 	it is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street chic, a lot of leather.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.46.21.874-00.46.23.110 	all the women are heavily made-up.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.46.22.278-00.46.23.400 	from the way fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.46.47.393-00.46.48.759 	fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.51.05.576-00.51.07.509 	but his voice is softer.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.51.36.906-00.51.39.311 	dave is rising.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.51.56.500-00.51.59.401 	there is a movement lower down the staircase.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.53.50.076-00.53.52.655 	they are walking in an alleyway toward her house.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.54.46.001-00.54.50.298 	he looks around the room; there is an exaggerated femininity about everything in it.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.54.58.822-00.55.00.592 	his reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside--dave's.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.58.08.394-00.58.12.748 	there are tears in his eyes.
0028_The_Crying_Game_00.59.57.687-01.00.01.935 	the woman is singing.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.02.21.281-01.02.24.258 	he looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.03.58.421-01.04.00.889 	the camera travels with it, and we see, in a close-up, that she is a man.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.04.56.183-01.04.58.924 	she is sitting on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.06.47.710-01.06.49.419 	the blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.07.23.568-01.07.26.383 	below the scoreboard we can see dil walking across a lawn toward the building where fergus is working.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.08.16.724-01.08.17.145 	he looks out the gap where the window should be and sees dil in the lift.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.10.25.048-01.10.26.073 	her face is wreathed in a smile.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.11.25.816-01.11.28.554 	dil, inside, is throwing off her smock and walking toward him.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.11.28.554-01.11.29.462 	all the girls are smiling.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.13.18.161-01.13.18.990 	her hair is now dark brown.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.16.45.648-01.16.46.138 	then the chair turns and we see it is jude.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.17.11.470-01.17.14.995 	he turns and sees jude is there.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.18.57.156-01.18.58.978 	there are tears in her eyes.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.19.19.131-01.19.26.392 	there is an expression in col's eyes that makes fergus feel very, very small.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.19.48.180-01.19.48.681 	fergus looks toward it, but jude is standing there, waiting.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.19.52.118-01.19.57.326 	she draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.20.24.329-01.20.25.502 	jude is driving, maguire next to her.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.21.22.814-01.21.25.960 	several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.22.44.754-01.22.48.348 	they walk down the street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-bar with some tables outside.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.23.05.334-01.23.06.418 	fergus is sweating.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.23.18.674-01.23.19.566 	there is an old, portly gent in a city suit emerging from it.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.23.30.567-01.23.32.731 	jude, from the cafe, watches--fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the daimler.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.24.26.120-01.24.27.432 	there are tears streaming down her face.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.25.25.003-01.25.28.025 	she allows herself to be led out.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.26.43.075-01.26.54.308 	close-up on dil's face as her hair is shorn.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.28.19.894-01.28.21.692 	she is wearing suspender-belts underneath her skirt.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.28.21.692-01.28.25.062 	but fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.30.47.786-01.30.49.144 	there is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.30.51.643-01.30.53.958 	the room is empty.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.30.56.573-01.31.00.654 	fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.31.13.152-01.31.14.914 	they are tussling in the darkness of the park.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.33.57.600-01.33.57.947 	she seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.34.07.631-01.34.09.159 	dil is lying back on it.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.34.43.931-01.34.47.758 	her voice is dreamily slurred, her eyes far away.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.35.38.797-01.35.50.313 	they are lying on the bed together, fully clothed.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.36.48.268-01.36.50.263 	she ties the other and is drawing it upward when he wakes.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.36.50.263-01.36.52.933 	she jerks the silk stocking so it is secure.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.38.35.891-01.38.39.133 	jude and maguire are in the car, parked across the street.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.41.36.080-01.41.39.677 	dil's face, close to fergus's, as the stockings that bound his hands are nearly undone.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.41.39.677-01.41.40.685 	his arm is free.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.42.15.150-01.42.16.202 	jude falls and is writhing on the floor.
0028_The_Crying_Game_01.45.56.627-01.46.01.900 	among them is dil, looking resplendent.
0029_The_Graduate_00.03.22.628-00.03.27.768 	now the bed on which he is lying moves as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.
0029_The_Graduate_00.04.37.158-00.04.39.156 	phil and mimi carlson are coming up the stairs as the braddocks are moving down.
0029_The_Graduate_00.11.46.291-00.11.50.347 	ben is half standing.
0029_The_Graduate_00.16.22.203-00.16.24.086 	there is a movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.
0029_The_Graduate_00.16.26.546-00.16.28.217 	mrs. robinson, naked, is shutting the door to the bedroom behind her.
0029_The_Graduate_00.17.00.151-00.17.03.805 	ben jumps up, gets the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
0029_The_Graduate_00.20.03.356-00.20.04.462 	she is now wearing the dress she wore earlier.
0029_The_Graduate_00.21.15.954-00.21.16.994 	standing and sitting around the pool are mr. and mrs. braddock, their friends mr. and mrs. arnold, and the arnold children, peter and louise, who are eight or nine.
0029_The_Graduate_00.21.17.768-00.21.17.981 	the braddocks, the arnolds and their children are dressed in california contemporary sport style: the adults in styles infinitely too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too old for them.
0029_The_Graduate_00.21.18.142-00.21.18.593 	the others are grouped, more or less, at the other end.
0029_The_Graduate_00.21.18.593-00.21.19.123 	mr. braddock is hamming it up.
0029_The_Graduate_00.21.24.474-00.21.26.886 	but mr. braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience.
0029_The_Graduate_00.22.56.783-00.22.59.419 	we are now looking through the mask as we move forward down the hall.
0029_The_Graduate_00.22.59.419-00.23.02.285 	everything is slightly distorted through the glass.
0029_The_Graduate_00.23.07.301-00.23.09.942 	mr. braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch.
0029_The_Graduate_00.23.12.945-00.23.14.356 	mr. braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.
0029_The_Graduate_00.24.58.589-00.25.00.044 	the booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.
0029_The_Graduate_00.25.39.129-00.25.45.500 	as he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of very old people start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps.
0029_The_Graduate_00.27.30.217-00.27.32.823 	miss dewitte, who, from the looks of things, always has been and always will be, miss dewitte, takes ben's hand.
0029_The_Graduate_00.27.41.555-00.27.43.760 	mrs. singleman looks at the seating list she has been holding.
0029_The_Graduate_00.27.55.344-00.27.58.405 	ben is backing out.
0029_The_Graduate_00.31.29.928-00.31.31.151 	a waiter is standing next to the table with a telephone.
0029_The_Graduate_00.31.54.258-00.31.55.050 	ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty feet away.
0029_The_Graduate_00.38.44.392-00.38.59.819 	ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds a beer can in one hand.
0029_The_Graduate_00.39.20.144-00.39.21.206 	mr. braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire.
0029_The_Graduate_00.39.21.206-00.39.24.897 	mrs. braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.
0029_The_Graduate_00.39.53.633-00.39.54.579 	he is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.
0029_The_Graduate_00.39.54.579-00.40.00.288 	pan with ben as he walks across the room past mrs. robinson who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her bracelet and watch.
0029_The_Graduate_00.40.39.833-00.40.47.228 	we now see behind ben the door that leads from the braddock den, in which ben is sitting.
0029_The_Graduate_00.40.47.228-00.40.48.885 	in the dining room, mr. and mrs. braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking through the doorways toward ben.

0029_The_Graduate_00.41.53.262-00.42.02.667 	follow ben as he gets up and moves to the windows of what is now his bedroom in the braddock house.
0029_The_Graduate_00.42.08.366-00.42.09.709 	the sun is bright outside.

0029_The_Graduate_00.43.06.947-00.43.07.858 	the sun is behind him.
0029_The_Graduate_00.53.07.725-00.53.10.064 	there is another long pause.
0029_The_Graduate_00.55.14.421-00.55.16.129 	mr. and mrs. braddock are there.
0029_The_Graduate_00.56.47.702-00.56.50.209 	mrs. robinson is sitting there.
0029_The_Graduate_00.59.57.142-01.00.02.830 	ben and elaine are seated at a table.
0029_The_Graduate_01.00.07.669-01.00.10.479 	the two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at elaine.
0029_The_Graduate_01.00.10.479-01.00.12.527 	the stripper is reflected in ben's glasses.
0029_The_Graduate_01.00.35.229-01.00.36.453 	she is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.

0029_The_Graduate_01.02.24.265-01.02.26.656 	she starts to give a little cry but before she can he is kissing her.
0029_The_Graduate_01.02.47.638-01.02.52.017 	she is watching him carefully.
0029_The_Graduate_01.02.57.696-01.02.58.187 	its radio is tuned into a rock and roll station and it is playing loudly.
0029_The_Graduate_01.03.28.277-01.03.30.106 	ben is talking with great animation -- elaine is watching him.
0029_The_Graduate_01.03.30.106-01.03.31.447 	they are both eating as ben talks, telling elaine a story.
0029_The_Graduate_01.03.31.447-01.03.32.837 	their windows are rolled up.
0029_The_Graduate_01.04.33.102-01.04.37.044 	there is a squeal of tires as ben almost drives off the road.
0029_The_Graduate_01.07.55.598-01.07.58.779 	it is raining.
0029_The_Graduate_01.07.58.779-01.07.59.773 	on the seat beside ben is a package.
0029_The_Graduate_01.07.59.773-01.08.00.429 	from the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
0029_The_Graduate_01.08.00.429-01.08.06.411 	ben's right hand is on it as he drives.
0029_The_Graduate_01.08.56.450-01.09.02.269 	there is a pause while ben looks at her expression.
0029_The_Graduate_01.09.24.625-01.09.25.417 	she is wearing a skirt and slip and carrying one shoe.
0029_The_Graduate_01.09.31.909-01.09.33.668 	mrs. robinson is just entering the house.
0029_The_Graduate_01.10.29.341-01.10.30.175 	she gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream.
0029_The_Graduate_01.11.39.840-01.11.44.656 	ben is standing behind a tree watching the robinson house.
0029_The_Graduate_01.11.44.656-01.11.46.649 	in the driveway of the robinson house, elaine is getting into the robinson car.
0029_The_Graduate_01.11.46.649-01.11.47.878 	mr. robinson is putting elaine's luggage into the car.
0029_The_Graduate_01.12.11.856-01.12.13.200 	he is writing.

0029_The_Graduate_01.12.20.208-01.12.24.779 	it is early morning.

0029_The_Graduate_01.16.25.652-01.16.32.513 	as they approach, they are joined by a tall boy with a beard.
0029_The_Graduate_01.19.44.077-01.19.45.001 	ben and elaine are walking along in front of one of the outside animal cages.
0029_The_Graduate_01.19.45.001-01.19.46.687 	ben is walking a step or two behind elaine.
0029_The_Graduate_01.21.19.560-01.21.21.752 	there is another knock.
0029_The_Graduate_01.21.22.523-01.21.25.019 	elaine is standing in the hall.
0029_The_Graduate_01.22.38.007-01.22.44.728 	several boys are gathering in the hallway trying to see into the room.

0029_The_Graduate_01.28.23.442-01.28.27.576 	ben is walking alongside elaine.
0029_The_Graduate_01.28.29.816-01.28.31.027 	on each side are open doors to classrooms with students filing into each of them.
0029_The_Graduate_01.28.34.372-01.28.35.636 	ben is left in the hall.

0029_The_Graduate_01.30.52.113-01.30.59.719 	ben is whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a time.
0029_The_Graduate_01.31.03.020-01.31.04.839 	the room is dark.
0029_The_Graduate_01.31.04.839-01.31.05.470 	the figure of a man is silhouetted against the window.

0029_The_Graduate_01.34.11.352-01.34.19.877 	ben driving his car sound: an envelope being read.
0029_The_Graduate_01.38.34.390-01.38.38.515 	ben is exhausted-looking.
0029_The_Graduate_01.39.18.806-01.39.20.486 	the gas station attendant is sitting reading a stock car magazine.
0029_The_Graduate_01.40.25.346-01.40.26.228 	the attendant is in the b.g.
0029_The_Graduate_01.42.33.552-01.42.35.729 	the other guests are ad-libbing their confusion.
0030_The_Hustler_00.00.49.847-00.00.51.475 	armstead's is a typical small town pool hall.
0030_The_Hustler_00.00.53.415-00.00.54.550 	the few people in armstead's this day are not playing; they sit and read the papers.
0030_The_Hustler_00.00.54.956-00.00.56.000 	charlie and eddie are at the bar, drinking straight bourbon.
0030_The_Hustler_00.01.48.444-00.01.49.750 	eddie is already at the table.
0030_The_Hustler_00.01.53.675-00.01.55.443 	the game is in mid-progress.
0030_The_Hustler_00.02.11.170-00.02.12.360 	several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play.
0030_The_Hustler_00.02.12.360-00.02.14.364 	the bartender refills the glasses as soon as they are emptied.
0030_The_Hustler_00.03.48.187-00.04.00.525 	they toss their money on the table, and eddie shoots, but his shot is too hard and his ball leaps over the side of the table.
0030_The_Hustler_00.05.51.185-00.05.52.324 	there is a cocky leer on his face as he reaches for the dollar bills.
0030_The_Hustler_00.08.21.712-00.08.29.168 	it is twelve-thirty when eddie felson and charlie burns first enter into ames.
0030_The_Hustler_00.08.29.168-00.08.31.243 	only one table is in use; the hall is empty.
0030_The_Hustler_00.08.31.243-00.08.32.951 	in eddie's hand is his leather cue case.
0030_The_Hustler_00.09.22.999-00.09.24.974 	eddie's arrival is noted by big john and preacher, a gambler and an addict, who hang out at ames at all hours, waiting for action.
0030_The_Hustler_00.10.06.002-00.10.09.671 	he runs his hand over the green felt as if he were caressing it.
0030_The_Hustler_00.10.14.543-00.10.17.070 	his last test is to sweep the cue ball into the corner pocket.
0030_The_Hustler_00.13.58.215-00.14.01.426 	even though ames is filled with players, there is little noise other than the clicking of pool balls.
0030_The_Hustler_00.15.58.846-00.15.59.847 	fats is in the washroom, scrubbing his hands and nails.
0030_The_Hustler_00.16.36.601-00.16.38.385 	they are ready to start.
0030_The_Hustler_00.16.57.555-00.17.00.698 	two balls are rolled to the end of the table, and fats and eddie, like two duelers, prepare to shoot for the break.
0030_The_Hustler_00.17.17.354-00.17.36.195 	the balls are returned and eddie makes his break shot, a glancing blow that leaves the pack of balls nearly intact and the white cue ball lying far away at the end of the table.
0030_The_Hustler_00.18.07.309-00.18.08.065 	the table is now his.
0030_The_Hustler_00.19.13.696-00.19.16.582 	it is eleven o'clock.
0030_The_Hustler_00.19.16.582-00.19.18.016 	eddie is up.
0030_The_Hustler_00.19.28.442-00.19.33.355 	the shot is a difficult one involving a combination of balls.
0030_The_Hustler_00.20.33.467-00.20.36.854 	it is twelve o'clock, and fats dominates the play.
0030_The_Hustler_00.21.09.509-00.21.11.187 	one-thirty and fats is still shooting.
0030_The_Hustler_00.23.24.094-00.23.25.653 	it is almost four o'clock.
0030_The_Hustler_00.24.30.713-00.24.31.718 	the man is bert gordon.
0030_The_Hustler_00.25.34.708-00.25.36.689 	only the voice of sausage is heard, signaling the end of a game.
0030_The_Hustler_00.25.36.689-00.25.37.618 	ames is empty now, except for the players and the employees.
0030_The_Hustler_00.25.51.640-00.25.52.424 	there is a break in the action.
0030_The_Hustler_00.28.01.103-00.28.04.453 	fats and bert exchange glances but nothing is said.
0030_The_Hustler_00.28.55.953-00.28.59.646 	behind him, in the washroom, is fats, washing his face and hands.
0030_The_Hustler_00.33.24.762-00.33.26.558 	fats is shooting.
0030_The_Hustler_00.33.28.020-00.33.30.371 	eddie is asleep on a stool against a wall.
0030_The_Hustler_00.33.30.371-00.33.33.314 	even bert is dozing.
0030_The_Hustler_00.35.22.438-00.35.43.655 	the blinds are drawn and the light strikes eddie in the eyes, but still he stumbles after fats, holding his money out before him, pleading.
0030_The_Hustler_00.36.13.172-00.36.17.464 	eddie is lying on his bed staring at the ceiling, the crashing of pool balls sounding in his head.
0030_The_Hustler_00.37.39.935-00.37.43.283 	he has been up all night.
0030_The_Hustler_00.37.58.655-00.38.01.523 	it is a typical bus station washroom at that time of the morning.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.01.523-00.38.04.108 	the residue of a full day's traveling is in evidence: crumpled paper towels, cigarette butts, etc.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.04.108-00.38.04.631 	part of the residue is a drunk who sits on the shoeshine seat, fast asleep.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.10.141-00.38.17.894 	a sign on the wall reads is this your lucky day?
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.31.334-00.38.35.320 	near the row of coin lockers in the waiting room is a small lunch counter and several tables.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.35.320-00.38.43.878 	at one table, facing the lockers, is a young woman, sarah: a book is open before her, and a cup of coffee, and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts.
0030_The_Hustler_00.38.56.199-00.38.57.200 	he now has on a clean shirt and is clean and freshly shaven.
0030_The_Hustler_00.39.38.312-00.39.39.490 	her hair is brown, cut short, practically straight.
0030_The_Hustler_00.39.39.490-00.39.40.797 	her lips are pale and thin, and the bone structure of her face, although delicate, is much in evidence.
0030_The_Hustler_00.39.42.943-00.39.44.332 	there is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self- sufficiency, about her.
0030_The_Hustler_00.41.49.953-00.41.50.483 	the bar is nearly empty when eddie comes in.
0030_The_Hustler_00.45.50.831-00.45.56.203 	there is a long pause as she tries to read his face.
0030_The_Hustler_00.49.16.249-00.49.19.546 	but the lunchroom is empty; only the janitor is there, mopping up.
0030_The_Hustler_00.50.18.392-00.50.21.036 	it is a friendly, neighborhood bar for business people and cocktail drinkers.
0030_The_Hustler_00.51.30.217-00.51.30.896 	the paper bag with the whisky is on the table.
0030_The_Hustler_00.59.37.695-00.59.39.492 	there is a long silence.
0030_The_Hustler_01.02.17.659-01.02.18.987 	eddie signals her to stay where she is.
0030_The_Hustler_01.05.18.975-01.05.21.022 	the room is a mess and sarah is drunk.
0030_The_Hustler_01.05.25.764-01.05.29.003 	her bottle and her glass are beside her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.05.29.003-01.05.39.611 	a bare- chested eddie is in the kitchen behind her, tossing empty cans and bottles from the sink into a garbage bag.
0030_The_Hustler_01.06.21.243-01.06.28.136 	sarah, still hopelessly drunk, is sprawled out on her bed, futilely attempting to dial a telephone.
0030_The_Hustler_01.08.56.453-01.08.58.535 	the poker game is in progress.
0030_The_Hustler_01.08.58.535-01.08.59.269 	four men are playing.
0030_The_Hustler_01.08.59.269-01.09.00.037 	one of them is bert gordon.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.01.174-01.09.02.811 	his glass of milk is beside him on the table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.28.999-01.09.31.795 	as the cards are dealt eddie steals a glance at the man he has come to see.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.32.804-01.09.34.716 	the game is over.
0030_The_Hustler_01.09.34.716-01.09.36.754 	bert is already in the front room.
0030_The_Hustler_01.15.14.308-01.15.22.358 	the atmosphere at arthur's is stifling, oppressive.
0030_The_Hustler_01.15.24.160-01.15.28.234 	in the back is a pool table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.15.58.784-01.16.02.270 	one of the other players is putting away his cue.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.37.889-01.17.41.365 	everyone is stunned, particularly the young man.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.45.397-01.17.49.068 	he is shooting as he did at ames, rapping in his shots with perfect control.
0030_The_Hustler_01.17.49.068-01.17.51.340 	he is completely oblivious to the glowering faces of the group of men who have gathered around the table to watch.
0030_The_Hustler_01.18.08.091-01.18.08.728 	all eyes are on eddie.
0030_The_Hustler_01.18.08.728-01.18.09.722 	sensing what is about to happen, the young man pays up.
0030_The_Hustler_01.18.56.112-01.19.03.096 	eddie tries to back off but there is nowhere to go, so he makes a casual movement toward the table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.19.48.018-01.19.53.446 	the ship's horn is heard again.
0030_The_Hustler_01.19.55.320-01.19.56.862 	there is a knock at the door.
0030_The_Hustler_01.20.08.602-01.20.11.629 	her eyes are puffy, her face is covered with perspiration.
0030_The_Hustler_01.20.26.970-01.20.45.229 	sarah is stunned and moves to him.
0030_The_Hustler_01.21.15.678-01.21.17.359 	they are seated at the breakfast table.
0030_The_Hustler_01.21.52.523-01.21.53.415 	the apartment is now clean and neat.
0030_The_Hustler_01.21.53.415-01.21.55.788 	and sarah is sober.
0030_The_Hustler_01.21.57.738-01.22.07.955 	she is at her table, typing, while eddie stands at the window, trying to reach over his shoulder to scratch his back.
0030_The_Hustler_01.23.46.500-01.23.47.611 	it is a warm, beautiful day, and sarah has a basket with her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.23.47.611-01.23.50.868 	eddie seems happy to be out with her, almost as if he has forgotten the casts on his hands.
0030_The_Hustler_01.27.30.958-01.27.32.555 	eddie is about to knock on the door to sarah's apartment.
0030_The_Hustler_01.27.34.045-01.27.35.831 	the casts are off.
0030_The_Hustler_01.29.27.104-01.29.29.878 	it is a quiet, elegant restaurant, one with soft piano music and subdued lighting.
0030_The_Hustler_01.30.49.218-01.30.52.083 	there is a long pause as eddie looks from the bottle to the waiter.
0030_The_Hustler_01.32.24.903-01.32.26.635 	it is raining heavily.
0030_The_Hustler_01.37.20.233-01.37.20.981 	sarah is in the washroom.
0030_The_Hustler_01.38.00.556-01.38.02.956 	they are at a table, sipping drinks.
0030_The_Hustler_01.39.02.585-01.39.03.207 	bert's own lighter is on the table, before him.
0030_The_Hustler_01.39.35.096-01.39.40.271 	the lobby is thronged with gamblers and their women, sportsmen, tourists, all there for the derby.
0030_The_Hustler_01.39.40.271-01.39.42.463 	a jazz combo can be heard over the din of their voices.
0030_The_Hustler_01.39.45.087-01.39.46.810 	behind them is bert, his face now shaded by dark glasses, following a bellhop to the main desk.
0030_The_Hustler_01.41.11.123-01.41.12.715 	the doors to the other suite are open.
0030_The_Hustler_01.42.43.179-01.42.47.527 	there is a long pause as he glares at her.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.11.587-01.43.18.543 	screams are heard as the horses jerk out of the starting gate to begin their runs.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.35.591-01.43.36.539 	sarah has been drinking.
0030_The_Hustler_01.43.58.866-01.43.59.218 	he is tall and refined, with a pale, debauched, yet oddly youthful face that some men of forty or more sometimes have.
0030_The_Hustler_01.46.55.466-01.47.01.183 	she moves past eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress

0030_The_Hustler_01.48.47.971-01.48.50.330 	a negro maid sits patiently in the room, watching over sarah and the coats that sarah is lying on.

0030_The_Hustler_01.49.30.101-01.49.34.022 	in the center of the room is the billiard table, now covered by a cloth.
0030_The_Hustler_01.51.43.527-01.51.46.480 	it is a figure of pan, with horns sticking up through his curly head, and the legs of a goat extending down below his waist.
0030_The_Hustler_01.53.07.122-01.53.11.731 	she is facing away from him but her eyes are open.
0030_The_Hustler_01.53.53.754-01.53.56.660 	his eyes are shut tight; his balled-up fists rub against his temples.
0030_The_Hustler_01.55.20.652-01.55.22.318 	a bucket of iced champagne sits on the desk, ready to be emptied.
0030_The_Hustler_01.55.30.244-01.55.31.475 	he is quiet, morose.
0030_The_Hustler_01.58.22.906-01.58.24.919 	sarah is there, seated primly on the bed.
0030_The_Hustler_01.58.24.919-01.58.27.625 	there is a drink in her hand, and a suitcase beside her on the bed.
0030_The_Hustler_01.58.40.019-01.58.44.257 	sarah's voice is subdued, controlled.
0030_The_Hustler_01.59.29.583-01.59.39.051 	he picks her up and tries to kiss her but she is cold and limp in his arms, so he lets go and she drops back on the bed.
0030_The_Hustler_02.00.20.244-02.00.20.732 	the sheets are rumpled and tossed about.
0030_The_Hustler_02.00.55.578-02.00.58.319 	eddie is just getting back.
0030_The_Hustler_02.03.14.485-02.03.16.026 	big john is at a pool table, trying out a few shots.
0030_The_Hustler_02.05.13.520-02.05.17.049 	the balls are already racked and ready.
0030_The_Hustler_02.07.57.269-02.07.58.268 	the balls are racked.
0030_The_Hustler_02.08.14.739-02.08.15.025 	then, fats is up; his jacket is off, his tie is pulled loose.
0030_The_Hustler_02.08.44.194-02.08.46.578 	but eddie is shooting pool now, making all his shots quickly and accurately.
0030_The_Hustler_02.08.58.340-02.08.59.784 	fats is still in his seat.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.02.29.348-00.02.30.699 	don, his back toward wick, is bent over the suitcase, packing.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.03.46.948-00.03.49.736 	from the living room has been coming the sound of wick opening the closet door and ransacking.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.04.38.901-00.04.41.077 	she is a clean-cut, good looking girl of twenty-six.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.04.40.195-00.04.42.504 	in her hand are two books wrapped, and another small package.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.04.40.477-00.04.42.257 	her face is brave, gay piquant.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.04.41.474-00.04.42.295 	the indian summer day is a good ten degrees too warm for the coat, but that doesn't stop helen from wearing her beloved.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.05.00.091-00.05.00.422 	his face is now close to hers.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.06.18.257-00.06.21.806 	there is an exchange of suspicious looks between wick and helen.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.06.52.792-00.06.54.847 	wick, who has been smoking a cigarette throughout the scene, throws it out the window.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.07.27.962-00.07.29.957 	wick flips the cigarette into the garden and is about to turn back into the room when his eyes fall on the cleat and the string.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.07.52.701-00.07.53.227 	hers are infinitely distressed.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.09.00.092-00.09.04.762 	don steps quickly to the door, presses his ear against it to hear what the two are saying outside.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.09.05.353-00.09.07.312 	it is narrow and simple.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.09.07.691-00.09.09.285 	every so often down the stair there is a light bracket, always burning.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.09.55.317-00.10.03.362 	don comes running in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch and reaches under the side of it which was towards the wall.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.10.09.674-00.10.12.908 	his face is covered with sweat.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.10.12.922-00.10.14.032 	just then, from the direction of the entrance door, there is the noise of a key being turned in the lock.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.11.04.076-00.11.07.443 	there's nothing but sugar in the bowl, but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.11.40.031-00.11.41.682 	the camera is behind the rack of liquor in a store on third avenue.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.11.40.803-00.11.47.233 	he peers into the shop to make sure there are no other customers, then quickly steps inside and stands breathing heavily.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.12.14.257-00.12.15.134 	it is a little short and the necks of the bottles protrude.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.12.29.444-00.12.30.094 	in front of it is a fruit stand.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.12.37.746-00.12.43.234 	he puts down a coin, then walks down the street toward the ladies, flaunting a paper bag which is obviously full of apples.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.12.46.332-00.12.47.329 	they are chatting.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.13.31.060-00.13.34.584 	don picks up the glass, is suddenly acutely aware of the people at the table, of nat's eyes.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.15.48.749-00.15.51.400 	gloria is back from the powder room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.15.55.192-00.15.56.594 	she is almost past him when he catches her hand and pulls her towards him.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.17.57.739-00.17.58.144 	the camera is on the wet rings which the wet glass has left on the bar.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.19.55.833-00.19.56.267 	the place is about half filled -- eight customers at the bar, five tables occupied.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.20.04.533-00.20.05.579 	it is dusk.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.20.05.579-00.20.07.608 	the electric lights are on.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.23.52.722-00.24.05.128 	the bar is silent except for the sizzling noise of the eggs and ham.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.27.45.543-00.27.47.271 	there is a guide of new york sticking from his pocket.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.29.57.188-00.30.08.327 	they are wearing raincoats, carrying umbrellas.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.29.57.562-00.29.59.013 	he is alone and wears a bowler and a straight raincoat.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.29.57.738-00.30.01.088 	a crowd of people is streaming into the building.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.05.309-00.30.13.502 	it is doing a land-office business, checking dripping umbrellas and apparel.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.06.256-00.30.07.654 	in the side pocket of his suit is a pint of liquor.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.08.327-00.30.13.762 	among the crowd is don birnam.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.30.25.588-00.30.26.895 	he is glancing through the program as the curtain rises (changing the light on our group).
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.31.12.725-00.31.18.717 	powdered footmen are pouring wine into the glasses of the over-vivacious guests.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.31.55.201-00.32.00.377 	alfred and violetta are batting the drinking song back and forth, as the chorus, glasses in hand, stands slowly swaying, echoing each couplet.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.32.03.066-00.32.05.070 	as he looks at the stage, his imagination is working at top speed.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.32.19.349-00.32.19.832 	the first drops of sweat are gathering on his forehead.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.32.56.029-00.32.56.938 	he is wiping his parched mouth.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.33.32.947-00.33.34.097 	don's nervousness is mounting.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.33.59.751-00.34.01.032 	he is biting his lips, unable to find another argument.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.35.06.711-00.35.12.308 	don takes the coat, feels it hurriedly to make sure the bottle is still there, and starts away.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.35.14.468-00.35.16.915 	helen is left with the leopard coat and his bowler.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.35.25.459-00.35.27.410 	helen, who is getting into her coat, can't catch it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.37.39.460-00.37.41.545 	there is a split second of indecision but it is ended by don's awareness of the bottle in his raincoat.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.37.40.645-00.37.41.290 	he is unfurling his raincoat in order to put it on before he steps from under the marquee.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.37.41.690-00.37.43.698 	helen is about a step and a half away when there is a crash.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.14.126-00.38.14.683 	it is dark and the rain has settled to a drizzle.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.38.30.230-00.38.31.915 	nat is now taking the chairs from the tables and arranging the bar for the afternoon and evening trade, while don leans back against the bar, the jigger of whiskey in his hand, and goes on talking.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.39.42.131-00.39.44.657 	it is filled with the routine activity of a big commercial hotel on a hot summer day.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.39.43.572-00.39.44.510 	under his arm is a florist's box.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.39.57.001-00.39.58.451 	on the other side of the settee are a middle-aged couple.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.40.12.630-00.40.18.316 	don can't see them, they can't see him, as he overhears their conversation, and it takes him a little time to realize that they are helen's parents.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.40.18.316-00.40.21.320 	mr. st. james is wearing a linen suit and a good but yellowing panama hat, the brim turned up.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.40.21.320-00.40.23.189 	mrs. st. james is a cheerful little woman with glasses pinned to her dress, the kind that pull.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.40.29.685-00.40.31.119 	mr. st. james is fuming a little.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.41.08.149-00.41.14.028 	there is a greeting, some conversation apparently about don and the fact that he'll get there any minute.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.41.26.760-00.41.37.358 	don deposits a nickel and dials the number of the hotel manhattan, which is above the mouthpiece of the phone.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.42.21.224-00.42.25.199 	don emerges with the florist's box, careful not to be seen.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.42.28.083-00.42.31.306 	a key is turned in the lock, and wick enters.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.43.40.988-00.43.44.963 	paying no attention to the sound of steps which has been coming from the staircase, wick rises, puts the glass of whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, short.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.45.01.561-00.45.04.600 	as he is starting towards the door, the bottle rolls from under the couch.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.46.16.650-00.46.20.774 	she is beginning to realize that he's drunk.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.52.03.557-00.52.16.821 	nat is behind the bar, putting tooth-picks into olives which he takes from a bowl and arranges in a row on a plate.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.55.41.758-00.55.42.581 	something is written on it but it is distorted by the glass.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.02.844-00.56.06.125 	the waiter takes the check which is thrust between his vest and his stiff shirt and puts it face down in front of don, then hurries on with the tray of drinks.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.24.494-00.56.29.741 	at that moment the waiter returns, expecting to be paid.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.43.935-00.56.49.554 	next him the couple is cooing away like spring, -- but on the bench between him and the girl lies her bag.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.45.368-00.56.45.779 	there must be some money in that bag.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.48.354-00.56.50.152 	the man is whispering something into the girl's ear.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.56.50.152-00.56.50.553 	she is shaking her head.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.57.38.143-00.57.39.992 	guests and waiters are passing by.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.57.46.252-00.57.49.374 	there is a tiny puzzled look from the waiter as don walks slowly towards the wash room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.57.49.974-00.57.53.378 	it's a two-wash-basin affair, with a colored attendant who, as don enters, is brushing a customer.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.57.51.149-00.57.52.252 	between his fingers is a cigarette, so that the whole thing looks fairly natural.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.58.14.414-00.58.16.631 	there, between a compact, lipstick and keyes, are some bills.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.58.16.331-00.58.19.476 	he fishes out a ten-dollar bill, thrusts it in his pocket and is about to close the purse when he sees the carnations.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.59.09.012-00.59.12.132 	in fact, he's suddenly aware that he is the focus of every eye in the room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_00.59.17.363-00.59.20.347 	's escort is right at him, grabbing him by the coat.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.00.04.407-01.00.06.768 	the doorman and the taxi drivers are staring after him.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.00.09.073-01.00.12.107 	it is meanly lighted by the wall brackets.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.00.15.336-01.00.18.309 	the newspaper, the bottle of milk, helen's note -- are all as they were.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.01.07.875-01.01.08.447 	on the ceiling is the shadow of the bottle which he hid in the light fixture.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.02.25.433-01.02.26.820 	only the telephone, which stands on the desk next the open portable, is alive.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.02.27.502-01.02.37.944 	he seems to be going straight to the ringing telephone, only he isn't.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.02.51.121-01.02.52.899 	the living room is in the same wild disorder -- books on the floor, a table on the chair under the ceiling fixture, the couch moved from the wall, clothes and shoes spilled from the closet.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.03.02.689-01.03.04.677 	one slow drop is all it yields.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.03.17.952-01.03.22.887 	what are his finances?
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.03.21.387-01.03.22.995 	in the palm of his hand there are exactly two cents.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.04.14.966-01.04.16.374 	there are now two newspapers, two bottles of milk.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.04.17.903-01.04.20.083 	the note from helen is still pinned to the door.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.04.42.144-01.04.44.936 	a steel gate is drawn across its entrance.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.04.49.156-01.04.49.701 	there is a woman standing nearby, wheeling a baby in a baby carriage.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.05.13.361-01.05.17.291 	in the next block, miles and miles away for the way he feels, is another pawn shop.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.05.16.992-01.05.20.293 	again every step is agony.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.05.49.580-01.05.53.106 	that pawn shop is closed too.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.05.51.556-01.05.52.888 	it too is closed.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.06.03.356-01.06.08.727 	across the street, in the same block, is the third pawn shop.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.07.26.427-01.07.27.293 	the time is twenty minutes of one.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.07.46.843-01.07.47.805 	nat is at the bar.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.07.48.838-01.07.49.523 	he and two or three customers are listening to race results on a little radio.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.08.35.508-01.08.37.859 	don is shaking so that he can't pick up the glass.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.09.41.836-01.09.43.552 	this is a really crummy third avenue house -- dark woodwork, paint peeling from the walls.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.09.50.185-01.09.55.355 	beside the door at the head of the stairs there are about three bells, for the several occupants of the apartment within.

0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.10.06.285-01.10.07.969 	she is wearing a dressing gown and bedroom slippers.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.10.07.969-01.10.12.049 	her hair is the ruined elaborate hairdress of yesterday, and her eyes are blazing with anger.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.22.914-01.14.24.012 	he is wearing flannel pajamas like all the rest of the patients.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.33.897-01.14.35.416 	along the walls are benches and a collection of wheel-chairs.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.35.337-01.14.38.474 	in the listless, burned-out collection, don is the only person who moves with purpose.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.35.388-01.14.36.677 	there are canvas slippers on his feet.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.35.416-01.14.35.895 	sitting on them and milling aimlessly around, are some thirty alcoholics.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.36.039-01.14.39.897 	it is l-shaped, about fourteen feet wide.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.38.037-01.14.41.462 	he goes around the bend of the ell and there is the door, a heavy wooden one with a grated peep-hole and beside it a uniformed guard.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.14.47.485-01.14.51.594 	at this moment the door is opened by another male nurse, carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillow cases.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.16.32.878-01.16.33.460 	it is lighted by a faint blue light, but the lights are on in the anteroom and some light comes through the glass doors.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.17.11.107-01.17.14.428 	on a cot in the corner is the man with the sensitive face and the addiction to beetles.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.17.15.756-01.17.18.589 	he is slapping wildly at his bed, moaning.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.17.45.213-01.17.47.696 	there is a wild scrabble as he fights them off.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.18.09.302-01.18.13.335 	seen through the glass doors, a doctor comes running down the ante-room, followed by another male nurse with a cart on which are hypodermic syringes, etc.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.18.10.256-01.18.11.099 	the doctor must have been in another building, because over his shoulders is flung a dark blue overcoat.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.18.15.095-01.18.21.459 	don looks after the doctor, then is fascinated by the coat lying beside him.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.18.27.502-01.18.31.693 	in the corner the three nurses and the doctor are working over the beetle patient, the doctor giving him a hypo, the nurses getting him into the straitjacket.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.23.40.714-01.23.42.764 	there is murder in his eyes.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.23.48.463-01.23.50.325 	the proprietor is completely under the spell of that terrible glance.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.23.58.286-01.24.03.932 	don enters, looks around the apartment, which is still in utter disorder.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.24.55.717-01.24.56.352 	the bottle next him is four-fifths empty.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.25.01.434-01.25.09.386 	in the wall above the couch, close to the door, there is a hole in the plaster, as if left by a large nail carelessly withdrawn so that some of the plaster went with it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.25.13.613-01.25.21.524 	at first don draws back, repelled, but the mouse is such a friendly, harmless creature that after a moment his face relaxes and he half smiles at it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.25.28.622-01.25.34.092 	it is a bat, swooping in slow loops around the room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.02.631-01.26.04.054 	beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle is going on.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.12.425-01.26.14.327 	she must have been listening from don's first scream.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.13.727-01.26.15.519 	sophie, standing beside her, is barking wildly.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.26.17.375-01.26.18.652 	beyond her, the door to her apartment is open.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.27.20.496-01.27.21.590 	his eyes are on the door.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.27.22.948-01.27.39.788 	don realizes he's forgotten to put it up, but it's not too late, is it?
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.27.59.827-01.28.01.560 	don is almost at the door.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.28.03.909-01.28.05.867 	don tries again, but by this time the door is open.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.28.05.591-01.28.07.446 	don throws all his weight against the door but it is no use.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.28.42.467-01.28.43.453 	they are beside the light switch.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.29.52.168-01.29.53.423 	don is panting hard, completely oblivious of the fact that helen is in the room.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.19.107-01.30.23.525 	he wears the dark suit (the one he wore to the opera) and as his eyes shift from helen to the coat, he is just tying his tie.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.30.144-01.30.33.383 	just as he is slipping out, comes.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.37.516-01.30.38.852 	she is wearing wick's foulard dressing gown.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.42.089-01.30.42.588 	she is barefooted, just wearing the foulard dressing gown.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.30.44.938-01.30.47.528 	don has already reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to helen.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.31.01.281-01.31.03.473 	don is just coming from it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.31.58.765-01.32.00.103 	the pawn broker has put helen's coat on a hanger and is brushing it.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.32.26.759-01.32.32.376 	on it lies a revolver and the second page of a letter on which don is writing.but amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear wick: i did finish something, didn't i?
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.32.41.768-01.32.42.352 	as he has been out in the rain, his hair is still a little damp.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.32.41.768-01.32.42.659 	don is seated at the desk.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.33.09.889-01.33.18.023 	as he is buttoning the second, there is a sound from outside.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.33.22.642-01.33.23.514 	the door is being opened.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.33.23.394-01.33.25.324 	she is breathing hard from her race to get there.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.33.24.424-01.33.25.694 	there is rain on her hair and her face, and her dress is wet.
0031_The_Lost_Weekend_01.34.37.763-01.34.39.531 	before she can step toward it, don is back with the scarf.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.13.271-00.01.14.182 	but the eyes are bright.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.13.275-00.01.16.260 	he has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to the kid, pinches his cheek.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.01.20.571-00.01.25.222 	and she is gone.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.02.23.595-00.02.29.330 	the story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the english countryside.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.02.46.848-00.02.54.591 	buttercup is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, westley, in the stable doorway, looks at her.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.02.51.591-00.02.53.733 	buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.02.53.733-00.02.55.155 	westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than buttercup.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.02.55.155-00.02.55.587 	and maybe as handsome as she is beautiful.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.03.51.311-00.04.01.483 	he gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to each other gazing into each other's eyes.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.04.07.019-00.04.10.852 	they are locked in a passionate kiss.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.05.59.684-00.06.02.631 	three others standing behind him: an old couple with crowns, the aging king and queen, and a dark bearded man who seems the prince's match in strength: this is count rugen.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.06.37.747-00.06.38.138 	and if there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd, collectively, holds its breath.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.34.206-00.07.35.279 	beyond them can be seen the waters of florin channel.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.35.279-00.07.36.353 	the three men are not your everyday commuter types.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.36.353-00.07.37.841 	standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.37.841-00.07.38.828 	he is sicilian and his name is vizzini.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.42.727-00.07.43.859 	beside him is a spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.44.363-00.07.44.702 	beside him is a giant.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.54.774-00.07.55.713 	a sailboat is moored.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.07.55.713-00.07.56.709 	it's dusk now, shadows are long.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.08.11.543-00.08.12.366 	there is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.09.13.059-00.09.18.140 	during this, inigo has gone close to fezzik, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.10.02.600-00.10.05.730 	inigo is at the helm, fezzik stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly--or do they?
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.10.05.730-00.10.07.074 	the waves are higher, there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.03.730-00.11.03.929 	it's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.07.374-00.11.08.497 	at this moment, they are all holding their breaths.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.10.682-00.11.12.846 	then-- the moon slips through and-- inigo was right--something is very much there.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.11.31.861-00.11.33.203 	the wind dies and as it does, something new is heard.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.12.01.548-00.12.11.182 	she's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- --and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her-- --and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- --and buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- --and the eel slithers closer, closer-- --and buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- --and now the eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.12.51.079-00.12.58.568 	and we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her, buttercup frozen, the shrieking eel, jaws wide, about to clamp down as we.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.13.02.257-00.13.04.030 	the boat and fezzik, buttercup being deposited on the deck.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.13.23.754-00.13.27.740 	the boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a man in black, and his boat almost seems to be flying.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.13.42.672-00.13.45.500 	in a wild race for the cliffs and the man in black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as inigo sails with great precision straight at the cliffs.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.07.099-00.14.07.929 	suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.19.538-00.14.20.188 	all three are strapped to fezzik like papooses.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.26.125-00.14.30.291 	fezzik's group is only faintly visible far below.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.34.935-00.14.36.002 	this is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and it's a gasper.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.13.555-00.14.14.711 	buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.10.429-00.14.14.402 	fezzik is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.14.50.917-00.14.52.429 	he's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.15.15.929-00.15.17.151 	the man in black is cutting deeply into fezzik's lead.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.15.42.863-00.15.59.859 	vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the rope which is tied around a great rock while inigo helps the princess to her feet and fezzik just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.00.126-00.16.00.913 	nearby are some stone ruins.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.00.913-00.16.02.505 	once they might have been a fort, now the kind of resemble stonehenge.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.02.505-00.16.03.345 	the man in black, 75 feet from the top now, maybe less--maybe only 50--and his pace is as dazzling as before, and.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.35.585-00.16.36.831 	the man in black, and so he is.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.16.36.831-00.16.38.802 	very slowly, he is picking his way upwards, sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.23.196-00.17.23.868 	he is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.30.581-00.17.31.339 	he must be six inches closer to the top than when last we saw him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.31.339-00.17.31.976 	inigo is watching.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.30.031-00.17.30.449 	this is our two heroes meeting.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.18.45.150-00.18.47.853 	he dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.19.27.175-00.19.30.898 	he tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see several large rocks tumble out.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.21.56.863-00.22.04.542 	and what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on), and right from the beginning it looks different.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.34.942-00.22.38.831 	the man in black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.48.829-00.22.54.873 	the two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.57.314-00.22.59.608 	and behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the cliffs of insanity.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.02.332-00.23.03.782 	the cliff edge is very close now.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.03.782-00.23.04.254 	inigo is continually being forced toward it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.04.254-00.23.05.043 	inches from defeat, inigo is, in fact, all smiles.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.04.501-00.23.04.884 	the man in black, stunned, doing everything be can to keep inigo by the cliff edge.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.06.461-00.23.09.193 	now faster, inigo is in control and the man in black is desperate.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.09.193-00.23.11.314 	and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.11.314-00.23.17.489 	a rocky staircase leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the man in black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop inigo--nothing can stop inigo--and in a frenzy, the man in black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.15.587-00.23.16.569 	he tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.16.569-00.23.23.795 	and now the man in black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.23.795-00.23.26.294 	and now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.27.783-00.23.29.752 	and to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.29.328-00.23.30.243 	he tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing--the man in black seems to be in control.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.30.243-00.23.31.032 	and before inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.25.08.442-00.25.10.425 	vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the man in black can be seen running.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.25.37.324-00.25.38.083 	there is a large boulder nearby.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.25.46.657-00.25.48.156 	ahead is a bend in the trail.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.42.154-00.26.43.746 	the man in black is not now and has never been a shrimp.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.43.746-00.26.46.287 	but it's like he wasn't even there, fezzik towers over him so much.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.26.46.287-00.26.50.596 	there is a moment's pause, and then the man in black dives at fezzik's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.14.970-00.27.28.022 	fezzik considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the man in black slips down to avoid the charge, fezzik moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the man in black jumps for fezzik's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have fezzik's throat, locked across fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.40.124-00.27.47.785 	fezzik, as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the man in black.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.47.785-00.27.48.819 	and the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at fezzik's windpipe.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.51.434-00.27.53.992 	and the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.56.917-00.27.57.719 	and there isn't much breath coming.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.27.57.719-00.27.59.678 	the man in black, holding his grip as fezzik tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.03.332-00.28.03.593 	but there is just no air.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.52.167-00.28.53.548 	humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.53.548-00.28.54.110 	then again, maybe he is.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.28.41.374-00.28.45.583 	because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.37.967-00.29.38.459 	she is blindfolded.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.38.459-00.29.39.621 	a picnic spread is laid out.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.29.44.999-00.29.45.891 	the picnic is set on a lovely spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.31.20.045-00.31.21.562 	as vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the man in black's has been fast disappearing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.33.47.486-00.34.12.831 	he laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.35.01.451-00.35.03.453 	finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.36.04.058-00.36.04.666 	the picnic is spread as before.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.36.21.724-00.36.22.911 	buttercup, being spun into camera view, falling heavily as the man in black releases her.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.36.24.472-00.36.25.944 	we are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.36.24.085-00.36.24.797 	the drop is sharp and severe.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.36.24.797-00.36.26.146 	below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.37.02.886-00.37.06.898 	and probably, if she did not hate roberts so, there would be tears.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.25.568-00.38.31.421 	the man in black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.33.599-00.38.35.234 	the dust cloud caused by humperdinck's horses is rising up into the sky.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.35.234-00.38.37.656 	buttercup, and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.38.46.152-00.39.05.348 	a moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.41.00.899-00.41.07.336 	buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe westley is too, but he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.42.16.023-00.42.17.403 	buttercup is frozen with fear.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.43.03.664-00.43.08.612 	he's been chatting away the entire time.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.43.30.107-00.43.40.090 	westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.17.818-00.44.23.907 	buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way--it's lightning sand--a great patch of it, and it has her--a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying westley's name but then she is gone as we.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.32.170-00.44.35.297 	then be grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.40.385-00.44.41.393 	now nothing can be seen.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.44.47.173-00.44.48.660 	the r.o.u.s.--a rodent of unusual size--is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.45.23.036-00.45.24.634 	her face is caked with the white powder.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.45.24.634-00.45.26.642 	it is in her eyes, her ears, hair, mouth.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.45.57.423-00.46.02.210 	westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.45.48.024-00.45.50.063 	now there are two r.o.u.s.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.46.44.617-00.46.45.497 	but the r.o.u.s is back atop him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.48.30.464-00.48.32.147 	three warriors, armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.48.33.996-00.48.34.415 	behind humperdinck are the waters of the bay.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.48.54.253-00.48.55.903 	a third warrior, crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a tree blocking any escape westley might try.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.49.37.917-00.49.38.623 	westley is dazed.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.49.41.849-00.49.44.317 	buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off her feet onto humperdinck's horse, and off they go.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.50.01.008-00.50.03.380 	westley is looking at him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.52.03.511-00.52.06.962 	he studies westley, whose face is almost sad.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.52.08.617-00.52.10.086 	buttercup, and her face is sad.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.52.37.409-00.52.38.920 	and if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.52.46.252-00.52.48.500 	the kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.54.19.679-00.54.21.729 	she advances on buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.56.17.816-00.56.20.785 	the trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.56.24.217-00.56.26.492 	they are deeper into the grove now.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.56.43.437-00.56.48.620 	rugen is searching around.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.58.17.045-00.58.25.064 	westley, and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.59.09.883-00.59.11.851 	westley, in anguish so deep it is dizzying.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.59.16.915-00.59.20.234 	piles of papers are strewn all over.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.00.06.477-01.00.08.050 	a lot of hollering is going on.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.00.31.614-01.00.42.471 	the thieves are being rounded up by the brute squad, alarge group of large men.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.01.55.573-01.01.57.070 	and as the assistant brute is just about to club inigo's brains out, fezzik lets fly with a stupendous punch.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.06.10.993-01.06.11.595 	and there has never been such pain.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.07.14.267-01.07.16.568 	and fezzik crunches the albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.08.53.325-01.08.57.309 	he is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.10.16.295-01.10.17.204 	if mel brooks' 2000 year old man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.10.52.914-01.10.53.134 	fezzik carries westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.14.04.828-01.14.05.878 	it is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.14.18.158-01.14.23.461 	inigo accepts the pill as fezzik takes westley, who is stiff as a board now.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.15.15.342-01.15.20.336 	westley is the only one not amazed.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.15.49.439-01.15.51.748 	he is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.17.55.095-01.17.56.491 	this is it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.45.679-01.18.46.886 	standing in the back is count rugen.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.48.010-01.18.49.087 	four guards are in position flanking the chapel door.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.18.53.748-01.18.59.546 	the brutes and yellin, by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.19.09.471-01.19.12.354 	and it is a bit unnerving--a giant seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.19.12.354-01.19.16.752 	and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting westley.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.20.18.795-01.20.19.913 	and fezzik rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is indeed closing quickly.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.09.687-01.21.14.988 	actually fezzik is dragging westley, who is, in turn, dragging yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash--westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.36.088-01.21.40.833 	count rugen, as the confrontation is about to start.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.21.40.833-01.21.47.637 	and as his warriors attack-- inigo goes wild, and maybe the warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that--but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the fourth warrior is dead before the first one has even hit the floor.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.26.501-01.22.28.369 	fezzik with westley, who is still unable to walk under his own power.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.22.49.630-01.22.58.433 	the queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.10.625-01.25.10.934 	yellin's sword is beside him.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.20.413-01.25.22.042 	westley is helpless.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.25.55.861-01.25.57.239 	rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill inigo.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.05.900-01.26.07.785 	count rugen, stepping back for just a moment, watching as inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the count is about to strike again, inigo manages a little flick of his own and rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.18.649-01.26.23.041 	count rugen, suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.45.270-01.26.46.712 	then another move and his blade enters the count's right shoulder, the same spot inigo was wounded.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.51.578-01.26.53.764 	and now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash bleeding along one of rugen's cheeks.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.26.55.045-01.26.57.933 	the great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel slash bleeding on rugen's other cheek.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.27.06.659-01.27.08.231 	they are almost frozen like that for a moment.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.27.17.320-01.27.18.445 	his skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide, full of fear.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.27.24.456-01.27.25.470 	westley lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, yellin's sword at his side.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.27.25.470-01.27.27.137 	buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.28.52.318-01.28.57.590 	and now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.29.50.521-01.29.55.916 	and now he is standing, sword in fighting position.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.30.40.914-01.30.41.891 	humperdinck, and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.31.15.999-01.31.22.377 	what's happening, of course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so fezzik can catch her.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.31.22.377-01.31.27.957 	but her fall is in slow motion so you might think she was flying.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.32.08.396-01.32.09.349 	buttercup and westley, and at last their trials are done.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.33.23.373-01.33.24.587 	and his smile is enough.
0033_Amadeus_00.00.39.836-00.00.40.704 	we are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing.
0033_Amadeus_00.00.39.751-00.00.42.521 	up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by salieri's valet.
0033_Amadeus_00.00.42.521-00.00.46.369 	by his side is salieri's cook, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits.
0033_Amadeus_00.00.53.728-00.00.55.574 	both men are desperately worried: the valet is thin and middle-aged; the cook, plump and italian.
0033_Amadeus_00.00.47.658-00.00.50.787 	the candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay.
0033_Amadeus_00.02.20.330-00.02.21.281 	he has cut his throat but is still alive.
0033_Amadeus_00.03.10.988-00.03.13.056 	a crowded room of dancers is executing the slow portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.
0033_Amadeus_00.03.22.552-00.03.25.646 	as the fast music returns, we see old salieri being carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle- aged doctor in a tall hat.
0033_Amadeus_00.03.54.260-00.03.55.212 	the wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city.
0033_Amadeus_00.03.55.212-00.03.57.277 	inside the conveyance we see old salieri wrapped in blankets, half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants.
0033_Amadeus_00.04.51.557-00.04.52.976 	doctor gulden is walking down it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but somewhat self-important.
0033_Amadeus_00.04.53.507-00.04.54.037 	this is father vogler, chaplain at the hospital.
0033_Amadeus_00.11.29.774-00.11.30.572 	his father is a heavy- looking, self-approving man, obviously indifferent to the music.
0033_Amadeus_00.12.27.020-00.12.31.499 	mother salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing them round.
0033_Amadeus_00.12.39.610-00.12.41.935 	suddenly there is a gasp - he starts to choke violently on a fish bone.
0033_Amadeus_00.12.41.935-00.12.44.651 	all the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain.
0033_Amadeus_00.14.47.721-00.14.49.322 	a small group of gypsy musicians is playing in the background.
0033_Amadeus_00.15.27.179-00.15.28.749 	and wearing their employer's livery - are laying out music on stands at one end of the room.
0033_Amadeus_00.16.30.446-00.16.31.628 	several tables, dressed to the floor with cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery.
0033_Amadeus_00.15.55.628-00.16.12.951 	it is, in fact, salieri's idea of paradise!
0033_Amadeus_00.16.03.665-00.16.08.486 	salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant.
0033_Amadeus_00.16.32.748-00.16.35.914 	he is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things.
0033_Amadeus_00.16.32.314-00.16.37.207 	his attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.16.400-00.17.16.601 	he is age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the archbishop of salzburg upon it.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.08.201-00.17.13.068 	he is puzzled; constanze has disappeared.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.35.939-00.17.36.706 	the throng is mostly seated.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.34.807-00.17.35.939 	the musicians are in their places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments; the candles are all lit.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.23.563-00.17.24.191 	he is a small self- important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet skullcap.
0033_Amadeus_00.17.23.291-00.17.25.013 	he is followed by his chamberlain, the count arco.
0033_Amadeus_00.20.18.997-00.20.21.169 	the opening of the serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind-musicians.
0033_Amadeus_00.20.17.011-00.20.27.469 	guests turn around as mozart appears - bowing to the archbishop - and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing.
0033_Amadeus_00.21.04.510-00.21.07.513 	mozart is conducting the adagio from his serenade (k. 361), guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists.
0033_Amadeus_00.21.19.008-00.21.21.375 	the audience is clearly delighted.
0033_Amadeus_00.22.27.370-00.22.28.257 	a group of people who have attended the concert, among them constanze, are standing outside the private apartment.
0033_Amadeus_00.22.28.406-00.22.29.108 	mozart is suddenly delighted.
0033_Amadeus_00.22.36.998-00.22.39.175 	colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee.
0033_Amadeus_00.22.47.347-00.22.54.237 	salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the serenade.
0033_Amadeus_00.24.35.810-00.24.36.615 	he is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform.
0033_Amadeus_00.24.38.423-00.24.40.210 	around him but standing, are his chamberlain, johann von strack: stiff and highly correct.
0033_Amadeus_00.25.07.567-00.25.11.248 	at a side-table, two imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said.
0033_Amadeus_00.26.57.340-00.26.58.352 	on one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty.
0033_Amadeus_00.36.58.719-00.37.00.099 	joseph is clearly pleased.
0033_Amadeus_00.36.49.844-00.36.56.641 	gradually, he alters the music so that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in the marriage of figaro, non piu andrai.
0033_Amadeus_00.37.30.979-00.37.33.979 	salieri is sitting at his desk, staring at it.
0033_Amadeus_00.40.07.443-00.40.09.703 	we dissolve on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a turkish manner, and we are on.
0033_Amadeus_00.40.16.637-00.40.17.432 	the house is full.
0033_Amadeus_00.40.41.271-00.40.51.926 	watching the performance - which is conducted by mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra - we note von strack, orsini-rosenberg, bonno and von swieten, all grouped around the emperor, in a box.
0033_Amadeus_00.41.00.352-00.41.02.343 	in another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is constanze.
0033_Amadeus_00.41.01.143-00.41.02.531 	this is the formidable madame weber and her three daughters, constanze, josefa and sophie.
0033_Amadeus_00.41.00.843-00.41.02.220 	all are enraptured by the spectacle and madame weber is especially enraptured by being there at all.
0033_Amadeus_00.40.57.833-00.40.58.905 	cavalieri is singing martern aller arten from the line doch du bist entschlossen.
0033_Amadeus_00.43.38.246-00.43.39.843 	all the cast is lined up on stage.
0033_Amadeus_00.43.13.894-00.43.14.816 	mozart is conducting with happy excitement.
0033_Amadeus_00.43.40.229-00.43.41.365 	mozart bows frantically: he is over-excited.
0033_Amadeus_00.46.40.243-00.46.41.514 	cavalieri is glaring at mozart.
0033_Amadeus_00.50.42.978-00.50.54.425 	the young salieri is kneeling in desperation before the cross.
0033_Amadeus_00.51.37.353-00.51.37.778 	leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier.
0033_Amadeus_00.52.28.589-00.52.30.021 	the camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside constanze.
0033_Amadeus_00.52.34.596-00.52.35.371 	behind them are madame weber, josefa and sophie weber, and a very few others.
0033_Amadeus_01.02.13.086-01.02.15.387 	the court composer, oblivious to constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them.
0033_Amadeus_01.13.16.802-01.13.21.831 	the hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket.
0033_Amadeus_01.17.29.138-01.17.34.619 	also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.
0033_Amadeus_01.17.44.043-01.17.45.260 	leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair.
0033_Amadeus_01.18.41.844-01.18.42.621 	his face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.
0033_Amadeus_01.25.14.444-01.25.15.484 	all the bystanders are watching.
0033_Amadeus_01.26.35.732-01.26.37.141 	it is littered with manuscripts.
0033_Amadeus_01.26.40.213-01.26.41.517 	standing at the billiard table, mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table.
0033_Amadeus_01.26.44.372-01.26.46.108 	he is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation.
0033_Amadeus_01.31.03.324-01.31.07.935 	to its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street.
0033_Amadeus_01.31.16.966-01.31.21.537 	as soon as it goes, lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight.
0033_Amadeus_01.31.33.236-01.31.40.940 	an outdoor concert is being given.
0033_Amadeus_01.31.33.236-01.31.35.949 	mozart is actually playing the final movement of his e-flat concerto with an orchestra.
0033_Amadeus_01.32.00.263-01.32.02.323 	listening to him is a sizable audience, including the emperor, flanked by strack and von swieten.
0033_Amadeus_01.31.41.007-01.31.42.486 	the crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a delightful open-air scene.
0033_Amadeus_01.32.07.734-01.32.09.031 	lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver.
0033_Amadeus_01.32.00.936-01.32.06.736 	mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood.
0033_Amadeus_01.32.17.939-01.32.21.006 	lorl is opening the door admitting salieri.
0033_Amadeus_01.32.36.977-01.32.38.569 	the room is considerably tidier as a result of lorl's ministrations.
0033_Amadeus_01.32.53.645-01.32.56.361 	inside we see one gold snuff box: it is the one we saw mozart being presented with as a child in the vatican.
0033_Amadeus_01.41.26.591-01.41.27.982 	orsini-rosenberg and bonno are sitting with salieri.
0033_Amadeus_01.42.22.429-01.42.24.233 	mozart hands him the score from which he is conducting.
0033_Amadeus_01.45.37.015-01.45.39.260 	the recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence.
0033_Amadeus_01.46.14.469-01.46.15.720 	mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot.
0033_Amadeus_01.52.58.131-01.53.00.602 	cavalieri, in a mythological persian costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is salieri.
0033_Amadeus_01.53.15.482-01.53.16.603 	behind him, seated, are schikaneder and the three girls we saw before in mozart's apartment.
0033_Amadeus_01.56.56.856-01.56.57.831 	we also see that the theatre is only half full.
0033_Amadeus_01.58.30.046-01.58.32.762 	on stage don giovanni is seized and gripped by the statue's icy hand.
0033_Amadeus_02.17.00.573-02.17.01.227 	he is clearly terrified.
0033_Amadeus_02.16.04.663-02.16.07.737 	lorl is seen peeking out from the kitchen.
0033_Amadeus_02.19.50.263-02.19.50.890 	papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the fireplace; on the forte-piano lies mozart's masonic apron, woven with symbols.
0033_Amadeus_02.21.17.523-02.21.20.075 	he is, briefly, an irresponsible and happy boy again.
0033_Amadeus_02.21.19.175-02.21.25.053 	then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door.
0033_Amadeus_02.27.29.548-02.27.30.978 	an audience of ordinary german citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited.
0033_Amadeus_02.34.51.441-02.34.52.711 	he still wears his bird make-up and under his street cloak, his feathered costume is clearly seen.
0033_Amadeus_02.39.39.516-02.39.40.488 	he is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired.
0033_Amadeus_02.42.08.694-02.42.14.295 	a carriage is driving fast through the night.
0033_Amadeus_02.42.12.564-02.42.15.581 	the carriage is filled with passengers.
0033_Amadeus_02.43.01.051-02.43.04.379 	they are sleepless and sway to the motion of the vehicle.
0033_Amadeus_02.42.46.522-02.42.49.126 	we do not hear what he is saying to salieri, who still sits writing assiduously.
0033_Amadeus_02.42.49.522-02.42.50.861 	mozart is looking very sick: sweat is pouring from his forehead.
0033_Amadeus_02.45.06.674-02.45.07.790 	it is a cold wintry dawn.
0033_Amadeus_02.45.43.418-02.45.44.116 	the child's bed is obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped position.
0033_Amadeus_02.45.31.557-02.45.32.580 	it is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously littered with pages, is now completely bare.
0033_Amadeus_02.45.38.025-02.45.39.019 	mozart is asleep in the bed.
0033_Amadeus_02.45.43.648-02.45.44.460 	salieri is dozing on the nearby child's bed.
0033_Amadeus_02.45.38.160-02.45.38.988 	the room is full of the trailing smoke from guttering and guttered candles.
0038_Psycho_00.05.01.567-00.05.03.375 	she stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in.
0038_Psycho_00.09.56.703-00.09.57.951 	he starts quickly away when it looks like cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office.
0038_Psycho_00.09.57.351-00.10.04.492 	when the men are gone and the door is closed, caroline picks up a bundle, smiles at it.
0038_Psycho_00.10.07.649-00.10.21.514 	when the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, starts to open door as.
0038_Psycho_00.10.21.802-00.10.26.091 	cassidy is drinking from a large tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking.
0038_Psycho_00.16.09.144-00.16.10.618 	the patrolman is staring at her.
0038_Psycho_00.16.55.367-00.16.58.215 	the patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind her at a matched speed.
0038_Psycho_00.17.25.061-00.17.33.427 	the patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off after her.
0038_Psycho_00.18.32.876-00.18.40.652 	her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot.
0038_Psycho_00.18.44.843-00.18.49.268 	she stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a los angeles newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
0038_Psycho_00.19.11.221-00.19.13.608 	the car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for mary.
0038_Psycho_00.19.45.750-00.19.47.885 	he is staring over at her, his face dispassionate.
0038_Psycho_00.20.10.641-00.20.15.655 	the car dealer is returning.
0038_Psycho_00.23.44.294-00.23.48.876 	mary is driving tensely.
0038_Psycho_00.24.38.575-00.24.39.648 	camera is close on mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears.
0038_Psycho_00.24.45.752-00.24.47.287 	her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.
0038_Psycho_00.24.47.287-00.24.48.952 	we can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.
0038_Psycho_00.25.08.697-00.25.10.148 	darkness of evening is coming.
0038_Psycho_00.25.54.301-00.25.55.295 	it is completely dark now, night.
0038_Psycho_00.25.56.183-00.26.00.383 	she is becoming aware of the rain starting.
0038_Psycho_00.26.04.878-00.26.07.000 	the wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.
0038_Psycho_00.26.10.873-00.26.12.807 	the oncoming lights are fewer.
0038_Psycho_00.27.20.756-00.27.22.650 	the lights are on within the office.
0038_Psycho_00.27.37.886-00.27.40.570 	there is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.
0038_Psycho_00.28.11.820-00.28.16.032 	seeing that mary is on her way to the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his hand.
0038_Psycho_00.28.27.456-00.28.29.313 	he is norman bates, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft- spoken and hesitant.
0038_Psycho_00.28.29.013-00.28.33.351 	he is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration book.
0038_Psycho_00.28.41.770-00.28.51.733 	she takes the registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with the realization that she'd better use an alias.
0038_Psycho_00.29.12.504-00.29.15.168 	we see that there is a remaining key on the board.
0038_Psycho_00.31.14.286-00.31.15.367 	her handbag is next to the suitcase.
0038_Psycho_00.31.24.933-00.31.32.501 	she looks about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such places are obvious.
0038_Psycho_00.31.59.163-00.32.23.178 	she opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading.
0038_Psycho_00.32.24.735-00.32.29.249 	mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins.
0038_Psycho_00.32.29.249-00.32.31.612 	camera follows her to window and once there we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room.
0038_Psycho_00.33.38.037-00.33.52.672 	mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, past the office, stopping only when he is close to her.
0038_Psycho_00.34.25.842-00.34.28.546 	bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day.
0038_Psycho_00.34.51.044-00.34.55.923 	norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper.
0038_Psycho_00.41.58.022-00.42.00.958 	mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained by his anguish.
0038_Psycho_00.44.19.859-00.44.25.015 	norman turns his ear from the direction of the sounds, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen.
0038_Psycho_00.44.26.204-00.44.29.990 	now norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against.
0038_Psycho_00.44.35.177-00.44.36.680 	this end of the room is very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light striking norman's face.
0038_Psycho_00.44.38.834-00.44.41.586 	she is in her bra and halfslip.
0038_Psycho_00.46.04.696-00.46.07.966 	mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook.
0038_Psycho_00.47.27.632-00.47.30.095 	now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.
0038_Psycho_00.47.31.917-00.47.34.937 	mary's back is turned to the curtain.
0038_Psycho_01.05.13.515-01.05.16.009 	norman is holding the door open, so arbogast walks in.
0038_Psycho_01.07.07.458-01.07.12.923 	he takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make norman as happy as it is making him.
0038_Psycho_01.14.11.250-01.14.12.671 	there is a light on in the house.
0038_Psycho_01.14.11.250-01.14.12.568 	there is also a light on in norman's office.
0038_Psycho_01.16.34.972-01.16.36.498 	the house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall.
0038_Psycho_01.17.40.440-01.17.43.161 	lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't moved from it in the last hour.
0038_Psycho_01.17.40.740-01.17.43.461 	sam is pacing, occasionally stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again.
0038_Psycho_01.17.40.740-01.17.42.860 	there is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness in the small, otherwise cozy room.
0038_Psycho_01.18.52.799-01.18.56.212 	he is still.
0038_Psycho_01.19.28.664-01.19.31.127 	the store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room spilling in.
0038_Psycho_01.24.54.412-01.25.01.328 	the sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.
0038_Psycho_01.25.04.822-01.25.07.875 	norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up.
0038_Psycho_01.25.07.575-01.25.09.614 	he is staring at the shrike- like bird which is perched on the lamp shade.
0038_Psycho_01.28.01.496-01.28.05.290 	sam and lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted chapel.
0038_Psycho_01.29.17.156-01.29.22.744 	norman walks past sam, giving him the sort of quick, disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, goes onto the porch and into the office.
0038_Psycho_01.29.24.399-01.29.25.805 	sam and lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.
0038_Psycho_01.34.48.414-01.34.51.913 	as he passes the office, he is shocked to see norman standing just inside the open door.
0038_Psycho_01.36.17.812-01.36.19.523 	norman is behind the counter, standing, staring at sam who is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa.
0038_Psycho_01.36.42.782-01.36.45.676 	lila is halfway up the stairs.
0038_Psycho_01.36.49.803-01.36.51.673 	the door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is closed.
0038_Psycho_01.36.50.773-01.36.55.977 	there is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, and we see lila.
0038_Psycho_01.37.01.349-01.37.02.539 	the bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full- length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled with ashes.
0038_Psycho_01.37.20.446-01.37.22.882 	lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, hesitantly.
0038_Psycho_01.38.28.620-01.38.33.884 	lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to the room whose door is half-open.
0038_Psycho_01.38.10.613-01.38.12.548 	sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.
0038_Psycho_01.41.15.124-01.41.18.064 	it is the body of a woman long dead.
0038_Psycho_01.41.16.864-01.41.18.537 	the skin is dry and pulled away from the mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.
0038_Psycho_01.41.16.864-01.41.18.804 	the eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and flaky.
0038_Psycho_01.41.16.864-01.41.18.590 	the body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.
0038_Psycho_01.41.19.453-01.41.26.499 	and lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind her.
0038_Psycho_01.47.08.399-01.47.10.825 	the guard is carrying a folded blanket over his arm.
0038_Psycho_01.47.21.338-01.47.23.270 	of shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered glass.
0038_Psycho_01.47.17.570-01.47.21.310 	a guard in uniform is posted by the door, looking reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance into the room.
0038_Psycho_01.47.33.483-01.47.35.967 	the walls are white and plain.
0038_Psycho_01.48.42.068-01.48.45.127 	the chain is attached to mary's car.
0038_Psycho_01.48.43.838-01.48.45.113 	the car is coming out of the swamp.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.04.52.301-00.04.53.690 	the frame is a polished mahogany.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.06.15.168-00.06.17.093 	anna's eyes are emotional.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.09.52.960-00.09.58.882 	vincent is fully crying now.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.10.53.933-00.10.55.488 	words and phrases are circled throughout the file.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.10.59.053-00.11.00.608 	malcolm is brought out of his trance.
0041_The_Sixth_Sense_00.11.08.757-00.11.10.385 	cole is a munchkin of a boy with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around him.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.11.53.158-00.11.54.807 	he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.12.50.863-00.12.52.298 	indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where panama hat is climbing the ladder.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.13.07.169-00.13.09.906 	indy sees that the cross is about to be swept overboard.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.13.12.579-00.13.14.684 	he snatches up the cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.17.19.393-00.17.22.191 	indy is ushered into a large art deco apartment and left alone.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.17.22.191-00.17.25.481 	numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.17.26.295-00.17.29.267 	during the brief time that the door is open, we hear a cocktail party going on in the next room: voices and soft.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.17.48.742-00.17.51.914 	donovan goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.22.28.941-00.22.31.119 	brody is a step behind.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.22.29.919-00.22.32.787 	they climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.22.38.793-00.22.40.241 	we see the place has been ransacked.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.23.22.430-00.23.28.618 	as indy asks the question, he turns to a painting on the wall: a depiction of christ on the cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.24.29.306-00.24.35.292 	a limo is parked beside a private airliner that bears the donovan corporate logo.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.25.49.610-00.25.51.175 	eyes that are bright and intelligent.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.25.49.675-00.25.52.152 	she looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.27.17.390-00.27.24.310 	the minute elsa is out of earshot.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.27.32.931-00.27.36.157 	brody glances at the diary, then at the window -- noticing that the roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.28.16.944-00.28.17.417 	indy has discovered that each column is numbered with a roman numeral.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.29.56.472-00.30.04.631 	as he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a two-foot square hole is revealed.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.30.11.106-00.30.16.917 	indy is impressed with elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeably -- holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.32.53.750-00.33.00.515 	the water is knee- deep and teeming with rats.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.34.04.985-00.34.07.225 	the chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.34.11.545-00.34.16.610 	indy and elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved coffins like the scholars of antiquity that they are.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.34.16.080-00.34.17.564 	these are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.34.19.302-00.34.23.551 	one coffin is elevated above the others.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.35.15.369-00.35.18.942 	the missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.35.37.627-00.35.40.069 	this is followed by thousands of rats fleeing from around the corner of the narrow passageway, stampeding toward elsa and indy -- shrieking and squealing as they approach.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.36.03.224-00.36.04.858 	he looks at elsa -- they are both soaking wet.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.36.15.953-00.36.21.057 	the rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on elsa, who squirms and screams in terror.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.36.35.309-00.36.50.633 	cafe customers are startled to see indy and elsa climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.36.47.724-00.36.54.038 	indy's delight, however, is short-lived since kazim and two other turkish agents are running towards them with drawn guns.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.38.06.207-00.38.11.386 	turning, indy sees that elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.38.30.213-00.38.35.873 	but the enemy speedboat explodes as it is crushed between the two freighters, flying into the air and splashing back down into the water.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.39.20.562-00.39.28.268 	indy kicks kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being sucked through the churning water toward the steamer's giant propeller blades.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.39.28.268-00.39.41.459 	by now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.39.42.681-00.39.46.659 	the wind of the blades is on their necks.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.40.30.763-00.40.33.051 	or is it a tattoo?
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.40.30.763-00.40.33.051 	whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.40.39.186-00.40.41.465 	the boat is close to the edge of the canal.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.41.20.095-00.41.22.813 	brody is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.42.55.031-00.42.57.016 	he finds that elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.42.57.016-00.42.58.977 	he is worried for her, knocks and calls out.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.43.00.752-00.43.03.224 	elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.44.41.499-00.44.53.034 	this is superimposed over a map that charts their course from venice across austria toward salzburg.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.45.17.249-00.45.19.774 	he glances up to the beret elsa is wearing.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.45.29.292-00.45.30.760 	she now wears indy's fedora; indy is wearing elsa's beret.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.47.04.481-00.47.06.894 	he knocks at the door -- there is no response.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.47.10.417-00.47.13.572 	the room is dark and empty.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.47.22.728-00.47.25.705 	there is a wide ledge beneath each window -- but below that is a sheer drop.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.48.18.754-00.48.23.398 	henry is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.48.23.870-00.48.25.021 	henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.48.23.870-00.48.26.357 	he is examining the broken end carefully.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.50.41.103-00.50.44.285 	henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the s.s.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.51.39.357-00.51.43.199 	indy and henry rush back into the room where elsa had been left, only to find: a nazi colonel holding elsa hostage.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.52.06.420-00.52.08.161 	she is propelled directly into his arms.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.52.36.621-00.52.41.404 	indy is stunned.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.52.44.146-00.52.48.881 	indy and henry are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by vogel and elsa and two nazi guards.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.52.52.526-00.52.54.808 	indy and henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.53.19.525-00.53.23.469 	the man in the chair gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be walter donovan.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.57.07.664-00.57.16.290 	once they are gone, elsa turns to indy.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.57.44.725-00.57.46.488 	indy and henry are still tied back-to-back of course.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.57.33.588-00.57.36.358 	elsa bends to speak quietly into indy's ear which is near enough to henry's ear.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.58.31.626-00.58.36.161 	indy and henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.58.47.731-00.58.50.116 	henry is able to wiggle his hand towards indy's coat pocket.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.00.48.227-01.00.50.211 	their backs are turned to indy and henry.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.01.03.127-01.01.05.218 	four nazi radiomen and the woman are still hard at work with controls and coordinates.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.02.41.678-01.02.44.812 	a full-scale nazi boat dock has been built inside the cavern.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.03.10.341-01.03.13.083 	vogel sees that a motorboat is missing.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.07.50.218-01.07.56.188 	a nazi rally -- a book-burning is in process.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.07.54.388-01.08.00.157 	the mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as college students and nazi brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.08.04.044-01.08.07.040 	flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.09.05.211-01.09.09.347 	one of whom is now none other than indy, coming up to her before she knows he is there.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.11.48.108-01.11.51.158 	but indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.16.22.306-01.16.25.788 	the zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.16.34.132-01.16.36.795 	we also see a small bi-plane that is suspended from the zeppelin by a hook & crane device.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.17.11.987-01.17.14.298 	shrink in their seats as the messerschmidts (going three times as fast as they are) scream past on either side.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.19.05.028-01.19.06.505 	henry is a very nervous passenger.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.20.28.797-01.20.29.605 	swings around and is coming in for another pass.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.20.45.761-01.20.48.123 	sea gulls are shredded by the messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a feathery white puree that splatters against the cockpit and clogs the.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.22.44.155-01.22.48.453 	and we see that it is kazim, the spy at the court.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.22.53.069-01.22.57.666 	elsa is revealed coming down the stairs toward donovan and vogel.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.24.27.657-01.24.28.723 	the tank is a vintage world war i model with enormous treads.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.24.32.253-01.24.34.138 	henry and sallah are at indy's side as he views donovan's party in the distance.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.24.34.353-01.24.34.745 	parked nearby is a car containing all of their supplies.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.25.41.457-01.25.46.935 	the brethren are firing at the donovan party and are being fired on by the donovan party.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.26.58.110-01.26.59.265 	brody has been left alone in the tank.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.31.16.258-01.31.21.103 	indy pulls the trigger again -- his gun is empty!
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.31.25.339-01.31.27.140 	now indy is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.31.44.543-01.31.48.033 	one of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, nazi soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over indy.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.32.22.385-01.32.25.080 	the nazi soldier screams as he is dragged under the rolling tank.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.32.43.585-01.32.44.498 	indy's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.33.57.650-01.33.59.344 	the tank is approaching a cliff wall.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.34.56.842-01.34.59.015 	the bullet ricochets around the tank, past the tank driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.35.44.272-01.35.46.535 	before indy can answer, vogel is up and swinging with the shovel.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.38.18.761-01.38.21.966 	brody and sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.39.53.929-01.39.56.849 	its spectacular grecian facade is carved directly into the rock.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.40.55.990-01.41.05.718 	is about to approach the spot where a turkish soldier lies dead.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.41.04.218-01.41.06.063 	we don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been decapitated.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.41.51.844-01.41.54.338 	indy's group are relieved of their guns.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.41.56.456-01.42.00.749 	indy, henry, brody and sallah are brought forward by the nazi soldiers.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.44.52.689-01.44.53.880 	he is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.45.20.273-01.45.21.434 	from his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: a razor sharp triple.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.45.21.932-01.45.23.377 	now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a small corridor which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.45.56.890-01.46.00.518 	each cobble is engraved with a letter.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.46.27.496-01.46.30.188 	indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and indy falls up to his hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.47.19.310-01.47.25.386 	indy looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.48.22.232-01.48.35.812 	we see that he is in midair.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.48.37.600-01.48.47.387 	it is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.49.12.905-01.49.16.080 	a vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small temple.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.49.16.080-01.49.24.725 	and then he realizes that a man is praying at the altar!
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.49.24.725-01.49.26.371 	but he is dressed as what he is!
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.49.40.210-01.49.43.507 	indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the knight is a very ancient man.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.54.28.617-01.54.31.609 	the two nazi soldiers are over-awed by the possessors of the grail.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.54.38.662-01.54.40.187 	henry is too weak to even open his eyes.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.55.08.111-01.55.09.390 	the first thing he sees is the grail and they light up.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.56.29.271-01.56.38.748 	a rumbling sound is heard and the ground roars and shifts.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.57.01.672-01.57.04.530 	with her free hand, elsa is trying to get the grail.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.58.32.942-01.58.34.962 	from within the mountain temple, the roar of walls caving in is heard.
0051_Men_in_black_00.03.23.624-00.03.26.533 	he speaks in spanish, which is subtitled.
0051_Men_in_black_00.04.15.786-00.04.17.307 	he stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine whining as it barrels down the road toward them.
0051_Men_in_black_00.04.20.151-00.04.23.652 	kay, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, dee, mid-sixties, is just weary.
0051_Men_in_black_00.05.59.377-00.06.02.138 	the man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath -- a scaly space bastard, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at the top of his head.
0051_Men_in_black_00.08.40.934-00.08.41.711 	kay gestures behind him, where the men in black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.
0051_Men_in_black_00.09.00.014-00.09.02.696 	dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand.
0051_Men_in_black_00.09.48.317-00.09.49.138 	in the background, about ten feet behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.
0051_Men_in_black_00.09.49.138-00.09.49.781 	edwards is a lot faster, though.
0051_Men_in_black_00.10.03.079-00.10.05.543 	edwards is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second.
0051_Men_in_black_00.10.11.853-00.10.14.874 	the bus, of course, is completely filled with japanese tourists, and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.
0051_Men_in_black_00.10.50.705-00.10.51.927 	edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the perp blinks.
0051_Men_in_black_00.10.52.928-00.10.53.169 	edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the perp needs to pull out.
0051_Men_in_black_00.10.53.363-00.10.53.622 	his weapon, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen.
0051_Men_in_black_00.11.11.075-00.11.12.670 	after it passes, the perp is gone.
0051_Men_in_black_00.13.23.398-00.13.29.152 	edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun.
0051_Men_in_black_00.13.46.336-00.13.49.592 	his mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck.
0051_Men_in_black_00.13.49.767-00.13.52.210 	the skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.
0051_Men_in_black_00.17.07.316-00.17.09.385 	laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did).
0051_Men_in_black_00.17.16.299-00.17.16.876 	all he sees is laurel, facing whoever it is in the hallway.
0051_Men_in_black_00.17.18.072-00.17.22.550 	edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding flash from the corridor.
0051_Men_in_black_00.19.29.316-00.19.32.249 	edwards, seeing that kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.
0051_Men_in_black_00.19.39.179-00.19.39.553 	edwards is shocked.
0051_Men_in_black_00.24.41.947-00.24.43.076 	edwards's hand is, indeed, up.
0051_Men_in_black_00.27.41.218-00.27.42.683 	most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest.
0051_Men_in_black_00.27.50.856-00.27.51.675 	next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it.
0051_Men_in_black_00.28.03.454-00.28.03.756 	in the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl.
0051_Men_in_black_00.28.32.245-00.28.46.167 	zed and kay stand behind smoked glass, staring at the recruits, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.
0051_Men_in_black_00.29.19.716-00.29.20.769 	edwards is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.
0051_Men_in_black_00.29.20.937-00.29.21.419 	kay is outside the door, waiting for him.
0051_Men_in_black_00.29.32.367-00.29.33.073 	as they pass an alcove, edwards notices the six other recruits, who have been herded into a corner.
0051_Men_in_black_00.29.41.810-00.29.44.075 	alien shapes are visible within.
0051_Men_in_black_00.29.49.939-00.29.50.523 	dee and zed are there, much younger.
0051_Men_in_black_00.30.09.471-00.30.13.120 	giant models of rockets mark the fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.
0051_Men_in_black_00.35.11.339-00.35.19.432 	inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.
0051_Men_in_black_00.37.10.531-00.37.15.245 	zed, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to edwards, sizing him up.
0051_Men_in_black_00.37.34.464-00.37.35.165 	kay is at a computer terminal.
0051_Men_in_black_00.37.35.321-00.37.36.086 	on screen are edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything.
0051_Men_in_black_00.38.00.708-00.38.01.301 	on the computer screen is edwards' full name -- james darrel edwards iii.
0051_Men_in_black_00.38.05.307-00.38.05.578 	more letters are eliminated from his name.
0051_Men_in_black_00.38.40.989-00.38.41.194 	the older man (rosenberg), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box.
0051_Men_in_black_00.39.26.849-00.39.27.379 	zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of mib headquarters.
0051_Men_in_black_00.39.36.191-00.39.36.973 	there are five video monitors on a wall behind zed's desk, and on each monitor is another man in black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image.
0051_Men_in_black_00.41.39.264-00.41.43.146 	they speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled.
0051_Men_in_black_00.43.44.881-00.43.48.044 	mrs. redgick is in front, moaning in pain, holding her swollen belly.
0051_Men_in_black_00.45.42.267-00.45.44.712 	kay is furiously searching through the tabs; jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.
0051_Men_in_black_00.46.03.586-00.46.05.836 	the wrecked pickup truck is still there.
0051_Men_in_black_00.48.52.344-00.48.52.653 	kay is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating.
0051_Men_in_black_00.51.26.883-00.51.30.510 	jay and kay are standing there.
0051_Men_in_black_00.51.39.197-00.51.43.726 	she gets up and goes to the arquillian's body, which is still out on a table under the lights.
0051_Men_in_black_00.52.33.964-00.52.35.384 	just by the look on jay's face, one can imagine how disgusting it is.
0051_Men_in_black_00.53.58.433-00.54.02.860 	he walks across the morgue to kay, who is still examining the arquillian.
0051_Men_in_black_00.54.32.541-00.54.35.133 	there is strange stitching around the base of rosenberg's ear.
0051_Men_in_black_00.54.45.827-00.54.46.433 	though not quite dead, the tiny little green man is gravely wounded.
0051_Men_in_black_00.56.14.510-00.56.32.163 	kay and jay are not paying attention to laurel.
0051_Men_in_black_00.57.43.257-00.57.43.525 	the orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown.
0051_Men_in_black_00.57.44.012-00.57.46.638 	from inside, throaty wails of frustration can be heard.
0051_Men_in_black_00.57.46.744-00.57.50.131 	inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against edgar's repeated attempts to claw his way into it.
0051_Men_in_black_00.58.05.264-00.58.10.266 	inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless.
0051_Men_in_black_00.58.10.668-00.58.11.886 	but the rest of the box is empty.
0051_Men_in_black_01.00.03.236-01.00.05.669 	elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight.
0051_Men_in_black_01.00.59.243-01.01.00.839 	jay and kay cross back toward the lad (landed alien display), where each of the thousand or so aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering light.
0051_Men_in_black_01.01.01.024-01.01.02.938 	some lights are starting to go out.
0051_Men_in_black_01.03.29.468-01.03.30.152 	there are several photos of a cat on the wall.
0051_Men_in_black_01.03.30.321-01.03.31.288 	there is also a pile of bejeweled cat collars.
0051_Men_in_black_01.03.32.056-01.03.33.271 	jay's attention is broken by something through the window.
0051_Men_in_black_01.03.33.413-01.03.34.392 	outside, lumbering straight for the store, is edgar.
0051_Men_in_black_01.04.39.569-01.04.47.042 	after gesturing to the back of the orkin van, where edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, kay pulls out his cell phone.
0051_Men_in_black_01.04.54.361-01.04.57.531 	zed is in his office.
0051_Men_in_black_01.06.45.227-01.06.45.403 	the voice is coming from the dog.
0051_Men_in_black_01.06.49.101-01.06.51.240 	passerbys glare at kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog.
0051_Men_in_black_01.07.49.654-01.07.51.296 	kay lets go of frank, turns to jay, who is lost in thought.
0051_Men_in_black_01.08.12.054-01.08.13.779 	in the morgue, laurel is working at a desk when suddenly rosenberg's cat leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying.
0051_Men_in_black_01.08.21.039-01.08.22.661 	as it is written across the collar of the cat.
0051_Men_in_black_01.08.24.774-01.08.26.157 	the center is some sort of hardened, translucent material, light green in color.
0051_Men_in_black_01.08.33.103-01.08.37.378 	it's as if laurel is sucked into another universe.
0051_Men_in_black_01.12.19.056-01.12.19.494 	above him, tony, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid.
0051_Men_in_black_01.12.25.896-01.12.27.304 	laurel is at the end of her rope.
0051_Men_in_black_01.12.35.160-01.12.38.497 	kay races into the morgue just as the examination table explodes into the air, revealing edgar, who was hiding beneath it.
0051_Men_in_black_01.13.25.880-01.13.28.057 	jay and kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway.
0051_Men_in_black_01.14.22.034-01.14.25.628 	and jay starts running down the street, where dozens of cabs are waiting at the intersection.
0051_Men_in_black_01.14.57.361-01.15.05.443 	jay and kay rush in from the door under the world's fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the mib staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.
0051_Men_in_black_01.15.40.795-01.15.43.478 	-- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off.
0051_Men_in_black_01.16.25.921-01.16.30.138 	there, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 world's fair grounds.
0051_Men_in_black_01.16.30.423-01.16.31.410 	most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by -- -- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact.
0051_Men_in_black_01.16.51.679-01.16.52.223 	behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the front of the postcard he's been carrying around.
0051_Men_in_black_01.18.54.009-01.18.54.361 	edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach.
0051_Men_in_black_01.19.20.592-01.19.20.756 	the shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel.
0051_Men_in_black_01.20.25.191-01.20.32.238 	but then, there is a vacuum whump, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the barrel of the guns.
0051_Men_in_black_01.20.32.239-01.20.32.557 	jay and kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, thudding to their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator.
0051_Men_in_black_01.20.32.558-01.20.35.882 	the shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it hits the ship -- -- and it too is sucked back down.
0051_Men_in_black_01.21.19.767-01.21.21.546 	and the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off-kilter in a mound of debris.
0051_Men_in_black_01.22.23.630-01.22.34.167 	he extends both pincers to the sides, and, my god, his reach must be twelve feet across.
0051_Men_in_black_01.25.43.100-01.25.44.822 	laurel is still watching.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.01.43.118-00.01.51.177 	parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.01.58.805-00.02.03.103 	it is unmistakably a voice, it is not the wind, parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.02.03.813-00.02.15.696 	all beweildered, parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.02.22.814-00.02.32.581 	parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening?
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.02.56.092-00.03.02.760 	ubiquitous is allison, 35, parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.03.53.906-00.03.59.509 	parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by allison who, on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.04.40.389-00.04.46.381 	parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing in intensity.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.15.37.289-00.15.50.749 	drew is still at parrish's heels, but now parrish stops at the open door, turns back to him, reminding drew that this is as far as he goes without being invited.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.16.14.969-00.16.20.200 	it is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.17.33.028-00.17.41.355 	suddenly parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.17.41.355-00.17.47.941 	parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.17.50.092-00.17.53.062 	parrish is possessed.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.19.40.890-00.19.46.593 	susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and vulnerable.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.23.03.436-00.23.10.415 	parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the voice.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.23.23.140-00.23.25.552 	parrish is confounded.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.23.58.570-00.24.04.575 	parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.24.04.575-00.24.15.684 	the conversation swirls on around parrish, he is deaf to it.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.24.14.200-00.24.21.996 	parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of himself.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.25.13.219-00.25.18.558 	parrish is stunned.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.25.45.120-00.25.49.290 	allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into disappointed silence as parrish leaves the room.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.26.06.133-00.26.07.879 	the door is open.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.26.15.858-00.26.20.178 	a beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.26.29.962-00.26.37.433 	parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his eyes searching the room for the voice, the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.27.48.724-00.27.51.745 	now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured glass, the section of the room most distant from parrish, there is a shape.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.27.45.871-00.27.48.724 	something is there.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.28.20.569-00.28.23.330 	parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.30.20.122-00.30.31.515 	the figure who is the voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, revealing himself to be the young man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, offcenter, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.30.56.852-00.31.25.455 	the young man steps closer to parrish, his face is inches from a shaking, sweating parrish's face, the young man daring parrish to identify him.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.33.02.346-00.33.05.079 	but the young man, spectacularly, is in front of him again.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.32.00.566-00.32.07.000 	parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what he has comprehended.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.32.54.751-00.33.06.500 	parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at luisa then at the young man, then once more at both of them as if to verify the young man's presence has been acknowledged by luisa.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.33.10.429-00.33.13.793 	parrish is frozen, dumbfounded.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.33.33.988-00.33.37.493 	parrish is frightened by the response.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.34.26.705-00.34.34.541 	as parrish and the young man enter, allison is heard in the background.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.34.34.541-00.34.48.483 	parrish and the young man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully surveyed.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.35.13.408-00.35.16.272 	parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the young man looks at each person as if he were discovering a face for the first time.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.36.51.853-00.37.00.568 	luisa has set a plate in front of joe, and parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.38.40.086-00.38.44.506 	at the kiss's conclusion susan suddenly notices joe is present and has been watching.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.38.44.506-00.38.47.014 	she is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.39.43.339-00.39.46.104 	joe is happily confounded by all the interaction.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.45.26.997-00.45.33.351 	susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black speedo suit, joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.45.26.997-00.45.36.158 	he observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.46.14.944-00.46.29.912 	joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to susan.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.48.04.539-00.48.15.516 	he shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.52.22.633-00.52.25.516 	parrish regards joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_00.52.25.516-00.52.29.836 	parrish is startled, he regards joe carefully.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.00.13.393-01.00.21.243 	the board is provoked and mystified by joe and even more by his presence, they cast meaningful glances at parrish, drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.01.10.910-01.01.19.338 	susan is busy giving instructions to a nurse, a patient on an examining table beside them.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.01.25.112-01.01.35.970 	she is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last notation, hands a chart to the nurse and heads down the corridor.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.02.23.812-01.02.27.851 	visible now behind them are a caribbean woman in her mid- thirties, teena, an arm around her mother, easter, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat, in great pain.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.04.12.930-01.04.17.852 	but when he looks and speaks to easter again, it is with concern and even regret.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.07.09.044-01.07.13.212 	joe is more abstracted than usual, he is staring at parrish's food.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.08.25.313-01.08.30.804 	joe is riveted on parrish ow, parrish aware of him, has paused.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.10.20.375-01.10.22.979 	drew is stunned.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.11.30.634-01.11.39.989 	allison and susan together by a piano; parrish, quince and a distracted joe are gathered near the terrace.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.16.32.662-01.16.34.133 	joe is locked on susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the room.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.17.32.877-01.17.35.587 	silence, parrish is at a loss.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.23.00.839-01.23.17.316 	they are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds them, a heaviness to the moment, now joe turns to head up the stairs.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.23.48.019-01.23.52.905 	susan is left alone now with parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.25.25.897-01.25.34.764 	the board of parrish communications is gathered, absent are parrish and quince.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.27.39.900-01.27.49.621 	the door opens and felicia enters followed by quince, sur- prised at seeing a convened board, but still he is all smiles.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.32.07.070-01.32.11.122 	a sense of foreboding falls over joe's face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a point of no return.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.37.32.881-01.37.40.711 	parrish and joe enter, the entire board is assembled, includ- ing drew, quince and sloane.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.38.17.270-01.38.19.696 	drew gets the message, at the same time joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on drew.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.40.33.381-01.40.36.864 	parrish is expressionless.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.42.04.134-01.42.14.640 	joe's eyes are riveted on drew.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.43.51.296-01.43.53.399 	quince is struck dumb.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.47.57.172-01.48.02.064 	her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.52.37.895-01.52.43.666 	joe and susan are at the front door, he has helped her on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.52.55.174-01.53.17.817 	the kiss lingers, susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at joe and then she is gone, joe closing the door softly after her.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.53.24.352-01.53.30.603 	he turns back into the foyer, looks up, parrish is on the balcony, it is clear he has observed joe and susan.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_01.58.34.913-01.58.37.341 	there is something in susan's tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.18.07.957-02.18.09.642 	joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.18.45.557-02.18.50.489 	parrish is beginning to reach joe.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.20.48.408-02.20.56.275 	joe makes his way down the path from parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and music of the party.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.25.27.097-02.25.32.669 	joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he drifts into a long silence.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.26.02.918-02.26.10.042 	susan is beside herself, her emotions tossed in every direction, joe steadies her.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.29.05.563-02.29.09.508 	parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the music and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.29.47.080-02.29.48.137 	the silence is broken by a knock on the door.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.31.00.792-02.31.02.845 	parrish is at his desk, joe in a distant corner of the room.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.32.40.059-02.32.41.814 	parrish is struck dumb.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.32.42.888-02.32.45.604 	drew is all attention.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.36.10.210-02.36.14.854 	drew is staring at joe, shaking his head.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.39.10.772-02.39.12.746 	now parrish spots allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.39.12.746-02.39.18.153 	parrish sees susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.39.25.329-02.39.35.548 	he heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.40.48.113-02.40.49.936 	susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.41.56.873-02.41.57.987 	on a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is joe.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.41.57.987-02.41.59.271 	his eyes are on parrish and susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.44.56.527-02.45.14.574 	when parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards joe.
0053_Rendezvous_mit_Joe_Black_02.49.08.167-02.49.18.308 	susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where joe and parrish disappeared.

1009_Spider-Man3_00.19.09.314-00.19.15.931 	peter swings down and is just grabbing the ring when harry strikes him again, sending him sprawling onto a rooftop.

1009_Spider-Man3_00.43.20.782-00.43.29.343 	peter is standing amidst the delirious crowd, smiling to himself, drinking in the adulation.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.44.44.619-00.44.46.003 	elsewhere, stoney-faced flint is lumbering along the street.
1009_Spider-Man3_00.46.15.686-00.46.31.952 	as bits of sandman crumble away in the gunfire, he sweeps down at the cops bursts in a bucket of sand blocking cars over as if they were toys.

1009_Spider-Man3_02.01.06.924-02.01.14.710 	being onto each other, they surf past sandman, and peter leaps off the sky stick and catches her.

2026_Legion_01.24.52.753-01.24.57.364 	it takes the creature a moment to realize that the clicking sound is coming from bob's silver zippo.
2026_Legion_01.24.56.899-01.24.58.382 	bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter.

2026_Legion_01.26.47.412-01.26.56.098 	jeep's side of the car is crushed.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.01.04.669-00.01.09.477 	the storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.02.34.354-00.02.37.306 	foreground convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.05.12.688-00.05.16.267 	valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last.

2027_Les_Miserables_00.15.26.147-00.15.27.043 	the beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.15.48.078-00.15.50.214 	the long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.16.58.638-00.17.00.705 	the letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women workers.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.21.03.393-00.21.05.154 	javert is puzzled.

2027_Les_Miserables_00.21.28.715-00.21.29.411 	at one end the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.22.16.061-00.22.17.894 	javert is not yet confident enough to continue.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.24.53.445-00.24.54.531 	fantine screams as the first tooth is removed.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.24.56.593-00.25.01.930 	the pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they're all fit for business.

2027_Les_Miserables_00.32.09.923-00.32.10.647 	fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.32.40.753-00.32.41.583 	javert is quietly coldly furious.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.33.05.566-00.33.06.533 	fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.36.01.697-00.36.03.893 	valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his papers once everyone else has gone, when javert enters and stands before him.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.38.27.251-00.38.29.536 	valjean is sitting staring at the bishop's candlesticks.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.39.07.036-00.39.14.153 	valjean is furiously packing stuff up.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.39.34.930-00.39.35.454 	the driver is valjean, hesitating.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.39.43.711-00.39.44.045 	the man accused of being jean valjean, a wretched down-and- out, stands before the judge.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.40.08.078-00.40.08.988 	the judge is too stunned to respond.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.47.15.163-00.47.16.340 	madame thenardier sees that cosette far from going is hiding behind the far wall.

2027_Les_Miserables_00.51.05.262-00.51.06.461 	thenardier is going through the groom's trousers.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.52.41.521-00.52.43.902 	she goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy.
2027_Les_Miserables_00.52.43.902-00.52.45.688 	cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and is now heading back.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.01.06.400-01.01.09.095 	now valjean and cosette are running - down narrow alleys, into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.01.18.717-01.01.20.403 	valjean and cosette turn into a street that is walled in by high windowless houses.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.08.38.509-01.08.42.780 	the carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.08.43.015-01.08.43.270 	the carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.08.46.488-01.08.49.927 	the crowd is made up of citizens of paris, student revolutionaries, the poor and beggars.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.09.18.969-01.09.19.142 	a priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two altar boys.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.09.30.675-01.09.31.270 	the occupant of the stopped carriage is monsieur gillenormand, marius' grandfather.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.09.31.270-01.09.31.687 	he is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson engaged in such an activity.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.10.08.169-01.10.09.139 	he is taking out a hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.10.11.253-01.10.12.199 	his eye is caught by the ring on his finger.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.10.52.614-01.10.55.900 	marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the gorbeau tenement by a passing carriage.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.10.58.664-01.10.59.463 	one is an old gentleman, valjean.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.10.59.463-01.11.00.323 	the other is a beautiful young girl, cosette.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.11.00.323-01.11.01.096 	the two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.11.05.570-01.11.07.053 	she too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he already knows her.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.11.20.220-01.11.20.768 	we cut further down the street to an alleyway where the thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for valjean's approach with their gang of crooks, babet, brujon, clacquesous, montparnasse.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.11.38.879-01.11.42.052 	thenardier approaches valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where madame thenardier is sat on the ground holding the crying infant.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.11.45.472-01.11.46.563 	cosette is a few steps behind, still entranced by the sight of marius.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.14.09.087-01.14.10.014 	he is furious.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.16.53.852-01.16.54.926 	but enjolras isn't smiling.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.21.12.791-01.21.18.266 	cosette is pacing in her bedroom.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.21.20.841-01.21.22.516 	her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.24.01.070-01.24.04.206 	at the far end is the walled garden behind which lies valjean's house.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.33.40.019-01.33.40.977 	grantaire is downstairs flirting with a barmaid.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.33.48.116-01.33.49.102 	madame hucheloup the proprietress of the cafe musain is sewing a red revolutionary flag to help the students.

2027_Les_Miserables_01.34.03.675-01.34.07.069 	monsieur and madame thenardier are in the ground-floor bar, slyly watching a student smuggling some rifles up the stairs disguised in a piece of cloth.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.38.23.639-01.38.24.878 	he slips away through the barricade, which is still rising.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.39.53.896-01.39.55.480 	the barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can be wheeled open to allow access.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.40.42.569-01.40.47.618 	javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back through the guarded `gate' into the barricaded street.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.44.16.359-01.44.18.088 	eponine is dying.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.49.10.568-01.49.10.905 	they are aiming at enjolras.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.49.14.372-01.49.16.140 	quickly other students join in and the snipers are driven back.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.49.16.140-01.49.19.707 	there is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a brief fire fight ensues.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.52.33.498-01.52.35.621 	marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the smaller barricades.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.52.49.481-01.52.59.315 	grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is taken up more seriously by feuilly.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.53.03.293-01.53.13.536 	bottles are passed round.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.53.29.694-01.53.33.591 	valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears marius through a window.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.57.05.293-01.57.15.462 	valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping marius.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.57.19.971-01.57.20.942 	many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.57.47.655-01.57.52.893 	below him the students are up and getting ready.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.57.54.217-01.57.54.972 	there is silence.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.01.19.105-02.01.22.719 	the big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.01.41.677-02.01.44.342 	enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.02.00.260-02.02.06.127 	the latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.02.25.079-02.02.31.759 	the students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the students are falling.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.02.32.419-02.02.35.369 	valjean has marius in his arms and is hiding him from the onrush of the soldiers - .
2027_Les_Miserables_02.10.29.236-02.10.38.745 	these are both the middle-class mothers of the students - enjolras's mother, grantaire's sister - and the working women of the slums for whom they died, united now in their grief.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.21.25.516-02.21.26.845 	next to the crucifix on the altar are valjean's two silver candlesticks, in which two candles burn.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.23.36.745-02.23.38.805 	valjean is joined by the ghost of fantine.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.27.33.657-02.27.34.707 	what remains is cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the man who has just died.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.27.38.491-02.27.40.058 	the walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.21.737-02.28.23.428 	dawn is breaking.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.44.304-02.28.45.164 	the triumphal column has long been completed, but the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories high, seven hundred feet long.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.45.164-02.28.46.224 	as the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many there are: thousand upon thousand.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.46.224-02.28.47.300 	as the marchers converge, there watching them are thenardier and his wife.
2034_Super_8_00.01.27.635-00.01.29.096 	cut wide to reveal that we are in a modest ohio house in the year 1979.
2034_Super_8_00.01.30.456-00.01.31.276 	many cars are parked outside the house, notably a sheriff's department squad car in the driveway.
2034_Super_8_00.04.19.535-00.04.22.399 	boys run off, just happy to be out.
2034_Super_8_00.04.26.457-00.04.30.577 	suddenly charles is there, red-faced -- he hands joe pages.
2034_Super_8_00.04.36.681-00.04.39.736 	suddenly cary is there, a burn wrap on his right arm now.
2034_Super_8_00.08.58.280-00.09.02.317 	joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up from under the table -- and jack sees that joe is holding his mother's locket.
2034_Super_8_00.10.18.985-00.10.22.639 	but now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14- year-old alice dainard.
2034_Super_8_00.12.24.863-00.12.25.794 	almost as if she were looking for something.
2034_Super_8_00.12.27.093-00.12.27.730 	the tension is almost too much for him to bear.
2034_Super_8_00.13.18.549-00.13.22.696 	there's something provocative for joe, being so close to alice, with her eyes closed.
2034_Super_8_00.13.26.613-00.13.28.166 	alice has been made up, wears a coat with purse.
2034_Super_8_00.15.16.683-00.15.22.252 	martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.
2034_Super_8_00.17.06.247-00.17.16.663 	alice and martin continue to yell their lines -- charles is almost laughing at how good this looks -- but joe looks desperately back toward the headlights -- the train lighting.
2034_Super_8_00.18.51.161-00.18.52.299 	just another few feet and he would've been crushed.
2034_Super_8_00.18.52.299-00.19.03.335 	but what was that sound?
2034_Super_8_00.18.52.299-00.19.03.335 	joe backs up, afraid -- it was almost a labored groan -- mechanical or animal?!
2034_Super_8_00.19.04.330-00.19.07.711 	joe turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the noise -- but it is gone.
2034_Super_8_00.20.28.122-00.20.33.013 	joe whips around -- standing in the dusty mess is alice -- shaken, but absolutely alive.
2034_Super_8_00.21.47.860-00.21.50.738 	thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is the pick-up truck.
2034_Super_8_00.22.45.851-00.22.51.231 	but he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he leans, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was holding a paper, that has now fallen onto the ground.
2034_Super_8_00.23.11.100-00.23.15.849 	but a shadow has appeared: a trembling hand -- before they can react, it rips the map away -- they all scream as old dr. woodward is revealed, bloody eyes open, in a daze.
2034_Super_8_00.24.04.477-00.24.07.904 	the rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them.
2034_Super_8_00.27.35.390-00.27.39.985 	joe is moving toward the living room, where charles sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the tv, a train crash being reported on the local news; helicopter shot of the wreck.
2034_Super_8_00.31.07.576-00.31.18.183 	alone, despite it all, joe is happy.
2034_Super_8_00.31.20.777-00.31.25.163 	martin -- as detective hathaway -- fires a gun -- shooting cary, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man turning into a zombie -- his eyes wide and glossy white -- and as he is hit by the bullets, he slams his hand onto his chest -- blood bursts all over him and he falls painfully to the ground.
2034_Super_8_00.31.33.020-00.31.33.545 	charles, joe and preston, with joe's dad's kodak camera on tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered.
2034_Super_8_00.31.33.545-00.31.33.916 	keep moving over them, to martin and alice, who were on camera.
2034_Super_8_00.32.22.072-00.32.22.892 	the car lot is across the street.
2034_Super_8_00.32.24.390-00.32.26.694 	a waitress is there, delivering more food.
2034_Super_8_00.34.44.331-00.34.47.247 	jack is with sheriff pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking up reports from his desk, on his way out.
2034_Super_8_00.35.35.249-00.35.35.799 	he is alone in the station store.
2034_Super_8_00.38.51.407-00.38.53.507 	charles is suddenly there, with cary.
2034_Super_8_00.40.02.751-00.40.17.014 	and alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance?
2034_Super_8_00.40.02.751-00.40.17.014 	or is this something else--?
2034_Super_8_00.41.52.468-00.41.53.892 	jack is disturbed by this.
2034_Super_8_00.47.16.025-00.47.23.298 	he heads for his office, seeing louis, who is being escorted out by an officer across the room.
2034_Super_8_00.47.39.957-00.47.42.237 	he could not be more self-conscious.
2034_Super_8_00.49.34.380-00.49.39.018 	jack is stunned.
2034_Super_8_00.51.12.100-00.51.16.346 	joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of alice -- he's taken back to the squad car.
2034_Super_8_00.53.00.088-00.53.01.789 	jack moves close to joe -- intimidating -- joe steps back -- jack is fucking intense.
2034_Super_8_00.53.13.755-00.53.18.152 	but somehow, in this moment, he can't be a better father than law officer.
2034_Super_8_00.54.22.056-00.54.23.144 	joe is motionless.
2034_Super_8_00.54.58.072-00.55.02.486 	suddenly the three large military trucks' headlights come on -- all aimed at jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see.
2034_Super_8_00.55.16.382-00.55.19.642 	nelec is quiet, simple.
2034_Super_8_00.55.28.009-00.55.29.136 	feels that his time on earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here.
2034_Super_8_00.55.42.419-00.55.50.811 	by the door, overmyer is quietly putting on his black gloves.
2034_Super_8_00.57.18.284-00.57.19.653 	joe is half asleep, but also stunned.
2034_Super_8_00.59.57.330-01.00.02.628 	watching his mother, joe is quietly stunned.
2034_Super_8_01.01.31.790-01.01.35.936 	then they look: the shuddering is coming from the cube he took from the crash site, sitting on his desk.
2034_Super_8_01.01.51.994-01.01.54.172 	they are amazed.
2034_Super_8_01.04.12.969-01.04.15.679 	louis is bleeding.
2034_Super_8_01.04.19.605-01.04.22.081 	alive is still looking back at the car -- so she doesn't see the shape that is coming behind her -- and just as she decides: i'm not going back, she turns to begin riding on.
2034_Super_8_01.04.22.719-01.04.29.045 	louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and his door is jammed shut -- he goes for the passenger door.
2034_Super_8_01.04.47.265-01.04.55.096 	the distant factory, the even more distant mountains, and an ominous plume of smoke -- a far-off siren is heard.
2034_Super_8_01.05.02.909-01.05.06.576 	joe stands at the counter with charles, who is in a bad mood.
2034_Super_8_01.06.19.779-01.06.22.383 	and suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: alice, from the night of the train crash.
2034_Super_8_01.06.49.700-01.06.51.655 	within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the settling debris.
2034_Super_8_01.06.52.332-01.06.59.358 	charles moves forward, so the film is now partially being projected on him.
2034_Super_8_01.07.51.373-01.08.01.522 	from the train car, through the wreckage -- what the hell is it?
2034_Super_8_01.08.34.561-01.08.38.016 	other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.
2034_Super_8_01.09.34.172-01.09.35.803 	orders are being barked -- residents can be heard, complaining and arguing.
2034_Super_8_01.09.56.007-01.09.59.943 	louis stares off, head bandaged, eyes open, muttering to himself, like a man as tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.
2034_Super_8_01.09.59.943-01.10.05.205 	find joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally sees louis and hurries to him.
2034_Super_8_01.10.30.211-01.10.32.644 	joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- he whispers.
2034_Super_8_01.11.01.984-01.11.04.158 	charles is in her face.
2034_Super_8_01.12.10.757-01.12.12.787 	jack, up all night and pissed off, but bored being pissed off, pounds on the door.
2034_Super_8_01.12.24.345-01.12.25.389 	jack is led down a dilapidated, narrow hall.
2034_Super_8_01.12.26.642-01.12.28.441 	as jack passes an open door, he spies an empty office -- through the window on the tarmac are a few military vehicles, a handful of airmen.
2034_Super_8_01.12.39.513-01.12.40.978 	he is fucking scared; at least he's holding a rifle.
2034_Super_8_01.15.08.637-01.15.13.147 	among them is 50-year-old woodward.
2034_Super_8_01.16.32.999-01.16.34.396 	inside, sitting almost in a ball, is the massive creature.
2034_Super_8_01.16.37.924-01.16.44.898 	the boys are scared as they watch the creature hold woodward tight -- lift him -- and its tentacles suddenly thrust into his nose, ears and mouth -- joe stands and looks intently at the screen.
2034_Super_8_01.17.43.895-01.17.47.295 	the locker hallway: the boys are handcuffed and scared, being led out by armed soldiers.
2034_Super_8_01.18.12.639-01.18.23.729 	the boys are put onto the bus -- boom down to donny's car in the foreground, where we realize that we haven't been the only audience to this: donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding, watches wide-eyed as the bus drives away.
2034_Super_8_01.19.10.440-01.19.19.902 	preston reads isaac asimov's science fiction magazine -- suddenly jack is there, grabs him and pulls him up.
2034_Super_8_01.20.02.411-01.20.03.638 	the entire bus is rocked, charles screams, hurt -- at the front of the bus, nelec falls -- hits a bench, then.
2034_Super_8_01.20.03.638-01.20.05.148 	the bus was hit so hard it rides for a moment only on its.
2034_Super_8_01.21.35.725-01.21.37.976 	the bus is slammed so hard.
2034_Super_8_01.22.49.585-01.22.53.401 	and there is joe and nelec, face-to-face -- joe seeing the fear in nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his fate.
2034_Super_8_01.23.03.273-01.23.06.877 	nelec turns -- the creature is busting the bus door -- smashing at it -- to make it bigger.
2034_Super_8_01.24.34.788-01.24.39.675 	standing is hard for heartsick louis, his legs so hurt -- suddenly jack is there, acting the role of air force.
2034_Super_8_01.25.32.374-01.25.35.636 	joe drives, donny is asleep.
2034_Super_8_01.25.45.728-01.25.47.919 	joe quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we push in tight on him -- from the direction they just came are more tanks and military vehicles -- joe's eyes go wide -- they're stuck.
2034_Super_8_01.26.58.175-01.27.04.976 	an explosion hits too close -- the boys scream as they run between houses -- and we track with them -- four boys racing through a neighborhood under siege -- power goes out -- and some explosions are much closer than others -- another big hit and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside.
2034_Super_8_01.27.33.892-01.27.36.278 	another fucking loud blast -- sound of glass breaking -- and the creature roaring -- and there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window -- joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts.
2034_Super_8_01.27.41.254-01.27.48.542 	they all go down -- but martin is in agony all of a sudden -- his leg ripped by concrete.
2034_Super_8_01.27.52.992-01.27.56.264 	but there's blood and martin is in real pain.
2034_Super_8_01.27.58.109-01.28.00.674 	charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a hole in it; military vehicles can be seen driving past outside.
2034_Super_8_01.28.50.103-01.28.51.402 	the third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.
2034_Super_8_01.28.51.402-01.29.10.571 	again and again, until finally the door kicks open -- and they almost fall inside -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking straight down from inside the shed -- the entire floor of the shed has been dug out -- dropping forty feet straight down, dirt piled, caked along the sides of the structure.
2034_Super_8_01.30.37.607-01.30.39.675 	there are three possible ways to go.
2034_Super_8_01.30.51.769-01.30.56.338 	we're so far away, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of sparkly light.
2034_Super_8_01.31.37.825-01.31.42.033 	cary is about to scream, but joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from pruitt.
2034_Super_8_01.31.42.033-01.31.51.377 	makeshift hanging bulbs provide some light; a number of other tunnels are visible from here, too.
2034_Super_8_01.33.07.065-01.33.09.651 	the sparkler dies as light begins to reveal joe, who slows -- peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the other side of the space.
2034_Super_8_01.36.05.793-01.36.10.773 	after running hard for a beat: they haul ass, but after a long moment tina is grabbed away into the darkness!!!
2034_Super_8_01.40.21.118-01.41.22.215 	formed -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, joe looks down: something in his pocket is moving -- he considers it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it out.
2034_Super_8_01.41.26.548-01.41.27.653 	and this is when we go into slow motion -- from here until the end.
2034_Super_8_01.41.41.302-01.41.44.247 	and joe looks at his mother -- and in this moment, she at him and jack's eyes suddenly well with tears -- alice, too, tears streaming down her face and finally jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on his son's shoulder -- which was all joe needed, really.
2034_Super_8_01.42.54.898-01.43.01.969 	joe and alice, jack, louis and cary watch, amazed, as the ship disappears into the night sky, we are tight on joe's hand, as it takes alice's.

2040_The_Ugly_Truth_01.15.04.228-01.15.07.121 	opening it with a smile, she finds -- standing there, bottle of red wine in hand, is colin.
