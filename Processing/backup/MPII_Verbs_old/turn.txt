0001_American_Beauty_00.07.20.401-00.07.23.805 	lester suddenly turns to jane.
0001_American_Beauty_00.10.00.454-00.10.00.989 	lester turns off the faucet,
0001_American_Beauty_00.21.32.828-00.21.33.954 	she turns suddenly, sensing our presence.
0001_American_Beauty_00.21.45.780-00.21.47.692 	his pov, on video: jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.
0001_American_Beauty_00.22.02.845-00.22.09.179 	she quickly turns off the light that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window.
0001_American_Beauty_00.22.25.811-00.22.26.748 	jane turns back into the room, her heart racing.
0001_American_Beauty_00.23.57.690-00.23.58.522 	startled, barbara turns to him.
0001_American_Beauty_00.31.17.739-00.31.34.018 	and he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins.
0001_American_Beauty_00.31.52.492-00.31.55.662 	lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room.
0001_American_Beauty_00.32.28.900-00.32.30.406 	finally lester turns back to ricky: what does this kid want.
0001_American_Beauty_00.36.17.414-00.36.30.666 	he turns, and is instantly transfixed by: angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair.
0001_American_Beauty_00.46.25.636-00.46.28.352 	still running, the jims turn back in perfect unison, as lester runs into frame, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants.
0001_American_Beauty_00.56.44.746-00.56.46.429 	lester turns down the volume on the stereo.
0001_American_Beauty_01.00.11.712-01.00.17.302 	barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly.
0001_American_Beauty_01.10.55.685-01.10.56.355 	startled, ricky turns around.
0001_American_Beauty_01.14.29.662-01.14.34.218 	the mercedes turns onto robin hood trail.
0001_American_Beauty_01.14.40.872-01.14.41.542 	we turn into the burnham driveway.
0001_American_Beauty_01.17.38.655-01.17.44.730 	carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry.
0001_American_Beauty_01.22.45.551-01.22.47.318 	he turns the digicam off and the tv screen goes blue.
0001_American_Beauty_01.35.10.831-01.35.16.219 	ricky grabs his backpack, turns and walks out the door, leaving the colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing heavily.
0001_American_Beauty_01.38.27.607-01.38.36.561 	jane turns to ricky and he takes her in his arms.
0001_American_Beauty_01.41.34.546-01.42.02.655 	the colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night.
0001_American_Beauty_01.48.51.401-01.49.01.855 	she turns her head to look out the window: the red door of the burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain.
0001_American_Beauty_01.49.24.425-01.49.27.601 	he turns to her and cocks an eyebrow.
0001_American_Beauty_01.53.46.992-01.53.49.462 	angela turns, frightened.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.00.43.459-00.00.43.636 	and now she turns and faces the hallway.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.08.44.601-00.08.45.818 	simon turns serious.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.11.16.905-00.11.20.049 	they turn away -- melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where two waitresses, lisa and carol, are talking.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.19.33.595-00.19.35.210 	and he turns and sees the naked model.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.21.26.560-00.21.27.112 	leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.30.16.932-00.30.18.675 	he turns toward her.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.34.17.975-00.34.23.522 	she is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.37.40.350-00.37.46.640 	he turns the lock.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_00.49.45.061-00.49.46.717 	he turns for.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.01.27.813-01.01.29.880 	simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's rapt.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.06.11.789-01.06.21.681 	well, he'll never get credit for the brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to scream -- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt during his half turn away from her -- and then answer hoarsely.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.25.04.951-01.25.06.360 	turning onto fifth.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.32.12.353-01.32.14.488 	she turns to him.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.44.16.217-01.44.19.685 	but she has already turned away and exits the restaurant.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.46.04.000-01.46.14.125 	we are on simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_01.47.11.164-01.47.19.308 	he takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at carol.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.05.40.712-02.05.43.350 	turning as the sudden blast of being buzzed into carol's life sounds.
0002_As_Good_As_It_Gets_02.05.55.756-02.05.57.619 	he half turns to leave.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.02.22.466-00.02.42.605 	a police officer takes a piece of paper from the typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.05.54.017-00.05.54.872 	but tonelli gets no further than that as strasser turns again to renault.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.15.14.255-00.15.16.477 	yvonne turns, looks at sacha, and extends her glass to him.
0003_CASABLANCA_00.24.11.950-00.24.14.536 	strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns to a certain page.

0003_CASABLANCA_01.22.27.870-01.22.29.574 	she turns and walks away from him.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.26.07.690-01.26.11.878 	he opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light.
0003_CASABLANCA_01.32.02.825-01.32.04.310 	he walks to the door, then stops and turns around.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.22.54.861-00.23.11.314 	he turns away impatiently, paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws the club on the couch, paces again.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.38.27.996-00.38.30.070 	he turns around and looks towards the car.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.45.11.772-00.45.13.810 	he covers the receiver with his hand and turns to keyes, who is now standing at the window.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.54.00.992-00.54.02.059 	neff is half turned away from the porter.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.16.669-01.12.17.527 	he pushes the call button and turns.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.12.35.695-01.12.37.313 	he pulls back the elevator door and turns to neff with one last glance of annoyance.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.16.43.701-01.16.50.130 	she turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.32.55.568-01.32.59.474 	he turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.34.04.372-01.34.06.010 	the lights are turned on.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.40.47.123-01.40.49.653 	he looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away.

0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.45.31.153-01.45.32.700 	he turns in it to look back at keyes' implacable face.
0011_Gandhi_00.02.56.261-00.02.58.882 	godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.38.228-00.03.40.290 	he is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and manu half obscures him.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.56.695-00.06.57.492 	he looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work.
0011_Gandhi_00.08.00.845-00.08.02.592 	he turns and walks out of the compartment.
0011_Gandhi_00.12.43.730-00.12.52.533 	and he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.34.839-00.13.36.075 	kahn turns back, extemporizing rather lamely.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.58.252-00.13.59.991 	the crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.04.414-00.14.11.453 	he gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and marches to khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon.
0011_Gandhi_00.14.31.568-00.14.32.486 	again, a murmur from the crowd turns him.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.07.559-00.15.14.775 	the sergeant turns from the commotion to see that gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.17.12.262-00.17.14.277 	he turns and waves to the parlor window.
0011_Gandhi_00.17.14.820-00.17.16.995 	and gandhi turns back, and starts down the long, hilly street.
0011_Gandhi_00.18.08.503-00.18.09.597 	they have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, run-down.
0011_Gandhi_00.19.41.971-00.19.43.746 	gandhi laughs as they turn the corner.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.12.731-00.20.13.477 	and now he turns to sonja.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.31.789-00.22.33.474 	gandhi turns to him, light-hearted again.
0011_Gandhi_00.23.09.950-00.23.11.643 	she turns back and walks into the building by the rear entrance.
0011_Gandhi_00.31.52.079-00.32.00.611 	a canvas-topped open touring car (circa 1910) pulls out from a turning between two factory buildings and comes towards them.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.40.489-00.32.42.352 	gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly, then turns and signals the miners on.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.53.496-00.33.21.442 	the car rides on past the factory building out of which it turned, and suddenly mounted police come swinging out from the buildings and face the procession.
0011_Gandhi_00.33.52.477-00.33.54.927 	the sense of the idea seizes gandhi, and as the sound of the galloping horses nears, he turns and shouts too.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.21.976-00.34.23.752 	he turns to see: the sergeant thrown off his horse.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.34.680-00.34.39.561 	he turns his horse angrily and gallops back toward the factories.
0011_Gandhi_00.35.03.816-00.35.07.015 	the sergeant wheels by the car with the civilian; his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.26.417-00.36.27.835 	when he turns and reacts to the sight of gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.32.468-00.42.33.911 	an english journalist catches him as he turns.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.56.329-00.43.57.333 	he finally turns to patel.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.46.291-00.56.46.765 	but he has half heard gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility.
0011_Gandhi_00.57.33.240-00.57.35.465 	nehru has turned, having caught that last remark.
0011_Gandhi_00.59.01.463-00.59.04.790 	nehru, who has been looking at gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to patel.
0011_Gandhi_01.01.44.658-01.01.44.983 	gandhi turns.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.34.682-01.03.36.599 	the captain turns briskly to two of his detail.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.43.214-01.03.46.833 	he turns his head slowly, his mouth agape at his point of view.
0011_Gandhi_01.05.19.041-01.05.21.709 	he looks around, then turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.57.520-01.07.58.871 	the wicket keeper makes a rude, facetious gesture, but as the batsman turns to settle in his crease again.
0011_Gandhi_01.09.45.509-01.09.50.769 	charlie turns to the guard.
0011_Gandhi_01.13.57.309-01.13.58.434 	as he smiles down at them, he is turned by.
0011_Gandhi_01.16.01.117-01.16.03.428 	the secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him.
0011_Gandhi_01.16.20.706-01.16.23.559 	he turns, offering sir george a whiskey in a finely cut glass of crystal.
0011_Gandhi_01.17.42.062-01.17.43.306 	gandhi turns.
0011_Gandhi_01.18.32.324-01.18.32.672 	holding his tea, he turns to gandhi with a little smile.
0011_Gandhi_01.19.10.362-01.19.27.239 	he holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him.
0011_Gandhi_01.21.31.588-01.21.32.856 	lord chelmsford turns expectantly.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.27.129-01.38.30.678 	it is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.50.009-01.41.52.141 	they turn back to the train and just as they do, the tall indian woman in the red sari tips a porter, taking one small bag from him and turns: mirabehn (madeleine slade) is tall, quite pretty and extremely english despite the sari.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.53.276-01.41.59.703 	the minute she turns, she stops on seeing the now startled kallenbach.
0011_Gandhi_01.44.02.022-01.44.05.175 	then he turns to mirabehn, made more aware of her by azad's reference.
0011_Gandhi_01.45.17.697-01.45.20.339 	some of the marchers turn at the shout.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.42.626-01.47.45.731 	they turn to him -- a sense of surprise, but they don't really believe he means the statement.
0011_Gandhi_01.48.27.291-01.48.30.350 	jinnah turns away in anger.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.46.055-01.50.48.724 	gandhi struggles to turn, and mirabehn helps him.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.48.724-01.50.58.067 	when he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.56.496-01.51.11.107 	she turns back, and propping up his head, helps him to sip.
0011_Gandhi_01.52.51.205-01.52.54.476 	during the very last of it mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion.
0011_Gandhi_01.52.56.498-01.52.58.479 	she starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again, then she turns suddenly, her attention caught.
0011_Gandhi_01.54.07.591-01.54.08.290 	he turns with a bright smile.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.30.481-01.55.32.568 	gandhi turns to mirabehn.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.58.473-01.56.00.831 	the clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.17.475-01.57.18.760 	the advocate general smiles with a brittle disdain, then he turns to the judge.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.20.488-01.57.24.797 	he turns, glancing at the empty table for defense counsel, and then to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.57.012-01.58.59.078 	he is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.38.067-02.01.38.897 	gandhi turns to them.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.42.264-02.01.44.624 	he becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and he turns to see walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.03.625-02.03.08.589 	he looks out to sea, and we intercut his face with walker's, the sea, and the town itself as the sun turns it white.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.47.845-02.03.49.927 	walker turns back to gandhi, puzzled.
0011_Gandhi_02.03.55.596-02.03.58.236 	he turns from the sea to walker, his eyes confident, elated, then he continues on down the promontory.
0011_Gandhi_02.05.37.320-02.05.40.777 	irwin has turned to him.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.02.902-02.07.04.309 	he turns back toward his bungalow.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.08.297-02.07.10.392 	gandhi holds their gaze a second, then turns and starts forward.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.52.556-02.07.55.371 	walker is turning, watching for a move from the police but begins to grasp that there may be none.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.52.538-02.08.53.710 	gandhi smiles and turns back.
0011_Gandhi_02.11.23.728-02.11.26.878 	finally, irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets, but answers the implied questions.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.21.344-02.14.23.846 	as he turns to leave irwin speaks -- almost offhandedly.
0011_Gandhi_02.15.27.468-02.15.29.843 	walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the salt works entrance.
0011_Gandhi_02.16.10.194-02.16.25.524 	he turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and the waiting lathis of the police.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.01.006-02.34.02.177 	the doctor turns his head slowly to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.36.279-02.36.37.178 	he turns to see that mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion.
0011_Gandhi_02.40.08.925-02.40.12.351 	he measures gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere, and when he is satisfied with that, he turns slowly to nehru, patel and azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.26.131-02.45.32.007 	he has turned and seen gandhi standing slowly.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.47.478-02.45.52.191 	gandhi turns, looks at him bleakly.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.49.702-02.48.51.083 	gandhi turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand.
0011_Gandhi_02.50.04.377-02.50.08.345 	nehru turns back -- this time no confidence, only concern.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.20.998-02.56.30.116 	his face stiffens, he swallows, fighting any show of emotion; then he turns to go.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.30.328-02.56.46.586 	but he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of hindu son to hindu father.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.28.44.510-00.28.50.755 	elliot turns on a light.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.41.51.675-00.41.56.282 	he walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic lee, just turning the corner.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.43.26.106-00.43.33.104 	a taxi turns a west side street corner and stops in front of evan and norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.53.45.957-00.53.47.419 	as he talks, lee is seen turning on the bathroom light.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.54.58.309-00.55.01.293 	he turns and looks at lee in surprise.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_00.56.02.622-00.56.07.613 	lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.19.43.442-01.19.58.184 	she opens her menu, then turns to lee, reacting suddenly to her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly upset.

0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.27.39.743-01.27.45.575 	laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which is almost as big as she is.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.28.11.752-01.28.15.143 	elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the partially closed door.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.29.51.535-01.29.53.805 	he turns off the lamp; the room is now pitch-black.
0049_Hannah_and_her_sisters_01.30.08.012-01.30.14.317 	elliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to hannah; she is lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.09.37.896-00.09.47.894 	he rushes out onto the balcony and sees: indy running along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.11.37.475-00.11.41.767 	he turns and speaks to indy in an ironic man-to-man way.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.19.43.552-00.19.44.885 	indy, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the grail tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.23.22.430-00.23.28.618 	as indy asks the question, he turns to a painting on the wall: a depiction of christ on the cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.24.58.628-00.25.07.401 	indy opens the grail diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.28.39.804-00.28.45.211 	he stops, turns, then looks down.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.38.06.207-00.38.11.386 	turning, indy sees that elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat.
0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.38.59.115-00.39.04.557 	as indy's boat drifts toward the giant, turning propellers at the stern of another steamer, kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_00.51.19.021-00.51.21.880 	he turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.

0050_Indiana_Jones_and_the_last_crusade_01.39.38.959-01.39.46.580 	now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city.
