0001_American_Beauty_00.11.02.154-00.11.21.276 	we see carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she: cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom; and vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.

0008_Fargo_00.34.54.914-00.34.57.242 	wider, we see marge now wearing a beige police uniform.
0008_Fargo_01.08.04.532-01.08.18.482 	through the door to the dining room we see wade picking up an extension.
0008_Fargo_01.12.26.026-01.12.33.425 	inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a prostrate body.
0008_Fargo_01.25.48.654-01.25.50.655 	behind him we see the cabin door opening.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.27.46.199-00.27.49.214 	forrest looks at jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.
0009_Forrest_Gump_00.48.15.949-00.48.29.480 	he uses his flashlight to see.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.03.23.238-00.03.24.209 	from the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, business machines, etc.)
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.09.35.779-00.09.36.928 	first we see her feet, with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left ankle.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.09.37.092-00.09.40.512 	camera pulls back slowly as she descends, until we see all of her.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.13.28.150-00.13.28.676 	he sees neff standing inside the door.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.33.43.537-00.33.44.878 	as she looks back she sees that lola is staring down at her wrist watch.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.39.49.662-00.39.50.276 	phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.51.46.466-00.51.50.307 	phyllis gets out and from the other side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind, and apparently dietrichson) climbs out awkwardly.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.52.26.539-00.52.27.426 	camera following them, a little to one side, so that phyllis is clearly seen but the man's face is not.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.52.58.752-00.52.59.681 	over them is heard the noise of the train coming into the station and its lights are seen.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.01.333-00.53.02.419 	a redcap sees them and runs up.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.53.14.819-00.53.16.633 	the conductor and porter see neff on his crutches and move to help him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.56.17.324-00.56.19.309 	she pulls the rug off the corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.58.14.110-00.58.16.546 	their lips are seen moving but what they say is not heard.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_00.59.27.506-00.59.28.554 	charlie sees him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.01.37.372-01.01.38.008 	he sees keyes and neff.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.13.57.487-01.13.58.298 	lola sees him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the anteroom without recognizing her she stops him.
0010_Frau_Ohne_Gewissen_01.16.43.701-01.16.50.130 	she turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.00.986-00.03.02.106 	we see him distantly through the crowd.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.08.818-00.03.17.373 	we do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls.
0011_Gandhi_00.03.36.572-00.03.38.228 	and now, for an instant we see gandhi close from his point of view.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.16.841-00.04.17.239 	the huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.17.138-00.04.21.925 	we see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.21.925-00.04.25.524 	we see the two hundred men of the army, navy and air force drawing the army weapon-carrier that bears the body of gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.04.08.785-00.04.15.631 	and finally we see gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence.
0011_Gandhi_00.05.11.432-00.05.17.538 	we see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the kings way.
0011_Gandhi_00.06.57.492-00.06.58.610 	gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so.
0011_Gandhi_00.09.39.421-00.09.43.517 	we see mr. baker, a wealthy white lawyer, whose home this is, poking at the fire, slightly amused at gandhi's na vet.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.32.835-00.11.35.119 	we see the english reporter waiting skeptically.
0011_Gandhi_00.11.44.014-00.11.45.248 	we see five or six women in saris standing together.
0011_Gandhi_00.13.58.252-00.13.59.991 	the crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.07.559-00.15.14.775 	the sergeant turns from the commotion to see that gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.33.972-00.15.37.908 	the sergeant draws a breath, grasping the club, but he bites his lip as he sees gandhi lift his head feebly, his shaking hands, stained with his own blood, groping for another card.
0011_Gandhi_00.20.46.195-00.20.47.231 	beneath the signature we see the boldly printed identification: jan christian smuts.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.21.189-00.21.21.645 	this is where the magazine indian opinion is printed and we see stacks of it lying around.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.58.970-00.23.01.405 	we see two women in saris cleaning the toilett.
0011_Gandhi_00.22.59.877-00.23.01.782 	in the background we see two women cleaning a latrine.
0011_Gandhi_00.26.14.073-00.26.15.186 	gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view, ending with two plainclothes european policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.08.398-00.32.09.247 	in it we can see two uniformed policemen and a civilian.
0011_Gandhi_00.34.21.976-00.34.23.752 	he turns to see: the sergeant thrown off his horse.
0011_Gandhi_00.36.25.357-00.36.26.130 	as gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large barrels of soup, he sees that khan is serving from one of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.38.06.045-00.38.09.146 	we have seen it before when walker spoke to smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk.
0011_Gandhi_00.40.05.521-00.40.08.969 	smuts signs the last document, then sees gandhi's doubt -- and misreads it.
0011_Gandhi_00.42.10.642-00.42.12.416 	a large crowd of indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see that person.
0011_Gandhi_00.43.04.182-00.43.05.562 	we see a banner: the congress party.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.06.763-00.46.08.653 	he meets prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the gandhi of south africa.
0011_Gandhi_00.46.21.912-00.46.23.008 	behind him we see patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society.
0011_Gandhi_00.51.21.290-00.51.27.074 	we see an english clergyman from the second class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some british enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun.
0011_Gandhi_00.54.15.354-00.54.17.206 	as they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.03.050-00.56.06.485 	and fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see gandhi -- again, the only one in an indian tunic -- sitting at the end of the second row on the platform.
0011_Gandhi_00.56.56.160-00.56.57.001 	this is the first time we have seen them.
0011_Gandhi_00.58.55.918-00.59.01.463 	we see one peasant face (shukla) -- which we will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways.
0011_Gandhi_01.03.36.760-01.03.38.604 	from its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be.
0011_Gandhi_01.06.04.640-01.06.09.062 	we see two young men, one seventeen perhaps, the other older, and a girl, sixteen.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.44.391-01.07.46.391 	it contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but ba.
0011_Gandhi_01.07.52.113-01.07.53.504 	the batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then.
0011_Gandhi_01.09.19.112-01.09.20.153 	and now we see gandhi in full shot for the first time.
0011_Gandhi_01.12.13.328-01.12.15.066 	we see the front row from his point of view.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.22.765-01.25.23.984 	we see muslims and hindus, many of them sikhs, old men, little children, women with babes in arms.
0011_Gandhi_01.25.25.458-01.25.27.390 	he clutches a copy (we need not see the title) of gandhi's journal.
0011_Gandhi_01.27.20.478-01.27.23.225 	a ripple of panic now, everyone pressing back, but still they cannot credit what they see.
0011_Gandhi_01.31.16.488-01.31.18.141 	we are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.54.987-01.37.55.303 	and we can see its cause.
0011_Gandhi_01.37.56.353-01.37.57.299 	as their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform.
0011_Gandhi_01.38.41.672-01.38.47.924 	in close shot we see other british soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.44.729-01.41.45.024 	in the chaos of the third class we see maulana azad coming out of a section of the coach.
0011_Gandhi_01.41.53.276-01.41.59.703 	the minute she turns, she stops on seeing the now startled kallenbach.
0011_Gandhi_01.47.37.623-01.47.38.154 	and now we see nehru and azad in the background too.
0011_Gandhi_01.49.19.736-01.49.25.771 	we see a few people working in the background, and a mass of people camped near the entrance, some sprawled, some sitting, some standing -- all waiting.
0011_Gandhi_01.50.48.724-01.50.58.067 	when he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.21.333-01.56.24.069 	the clerk, confused as well as astonished, see the judge standing, facing gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.39.314-01.58.43.032 	from far above the hills we see a car traveling along the road.
0011_Gandhi_01.58.57.012-01.58.59.078 	he is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees.
0011_Gandhi_01.59.15.048-01.59.17.098 	we see from walker's point of view an indian woman walking along the road, leading a tall camel that carries sacks of produce.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.42.264-02.01.44.624 	he becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and he turns to see walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder.
0011_Gandhi_02.06.25.984-02.06.28.118 	and suddenly a mass of people, hidden by the embankment, appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river, and the camera lifts slightly with their movement and we see that they are but the forerunners of a long tendril of humanity that stretches across the river, all the way back to the distant outskirts of the city.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.32.618-02.07.36.576 	to one side we see two police cars drawn up, and several policemen (a british officer, a british sergeant, and four indian constables) lined up near them.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.39.948-02.07.40.828 	among the newsmen we see collins.
0011_Gandhi_02.08.35.205-02.08.37.719 	the crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky.
0011_Gandhi_02.09.11.156-02.09.14.948 	as the procession trails into the village, we see several villagers, knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders, run around the police and join the end of the procession.
0011_Gandhi_02.14.35.329-02.14.37.076 	above the gate we see the sign dharasana salt works.

0011_Gandhi_02.25.30.763-02.25.35.434 	the camera tracks across the platform and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying ba.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.35.434-02.25.41.016 	and the camera tracks again and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying mirabehn.
0011_Gandhi_02.25.48.434-02.25.55.827 	as the jeep passes the camera we pan with it and see the walls of a palace ahead.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.21.549-02.34.24.017 	and slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.24.017-02.34.26.876 	we cut from the pennant to see the aircraft stopping before a reception area, a carpet rolled out toward its door.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.36.279-02.36.37.178 	he turns to see that mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion.
0011_Gandhi_02.36.56.975-02.37.01.932 	we have pulled back and we see a whole gathering of hindu youths near the entrance to the ashram.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.00.795-02.38.02.112 	we have seen azad and pyarelal come out on the porch behind nehru.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.05.160-02.38.08.008 	as they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths.
0011_Gandhi_02.38.08.008-02.38.09.970 	in the back seat we see two men, one of whom is prakash (the bearded man at gandhi's assassination).
0011_Gandhi_02.40.08.925-02.40.12.351 	he measures gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere, and when he is satisfied with that, he turns slowly to nehru, patel and azad.
0011_Gandhi_02.42.23.519-02.42.25.327 	inside we can just see mirabehn, spinning too.
0011_Gandhi_02.44.42.295-02.44.47.168 	patel and azad are there and pyarelal of course, and with them now the giant figure of abdul ghaffar khan, the first time we have seen him among gandhi's intimate group.
0011_Gandhi_02.45.26.131-02.45.32.007 	he has turned and seen gandhi standing slowly.
0011_Gandhi_02.47.15.950-02.47.17.446 	we see three or four black flags and stains of blood on many of them.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.36.061-02.48.37.931 	they are whispering quietly, but mirabehn has stopped on seeing nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting.
0011_Gandhi_02.48.51.083-02.48.52.464 	he does so with effort, and at last he sees patel.
0011_Gandhi_02.49.57.105-02.50.04.377 	he glances at patel, and we see that they recognize that their bland conviction that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply misplaced.
0011_Gandhi_02.51.50.289-02.51.51.036 	we see, just in passing, the frightened, apprehensive faces of godse, and near him, apte and karkare.
0011_Gandhi_02.53.40.569-02.53.59.700 	we see surly knots of belligerent rowdies, mostly young, but not all, hanging on the fringes as we move over the heads of the mass of listening people to a platform where nehru speaks.
0011_Gandhi_02.58.13.452-02.58.18.159 	we see the police commissioner, suhrawardy, two doctors, abdul ghaffar khan, and some others.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.49.948-02.59.51.656 	we get a wide-angle shot now and see that bourke-white is shooting one of her favorite subjects again.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.58.954-03.00.00.205 	abha suddenly holds a picture up for gandhi to see.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.16.201-03.01.19.398 	we see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.13.24.425-00.13.26.205 	the shape stirs, rolls over, and we see harry zimm, balding, overweight; a movie producer.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.15.02.796-00.15.07.310 	we can see this is a nice place as harry crosses the entry hall to a doorway, the flickering light of the television emitting from inside the room.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.17.49.351-00.17.50.327 	chili turns aronud and sees her standing in the doorway now, her arms folded across that chest, the lakers t-shirt coming down just past her crotch.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.18.59.653-00.19.01.401 	he's motioning to her for another, when we see a plane taxi past the window in the b.g.

0012_Get_Shorty_00.32.17.569-00.32.18.569 	ronnie opens his coat so that harry can see a gun tucked in his belt.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.40.09.628-00.40.09.783 	he rounds a corner, and we see an explosion of light up ahead as we come upon.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.40.14.223-00.40.15.652 	as he starts back, he sees leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.42.35.372-00.42.41.745 	chili flips through the script, sees a name.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.45.14.909-00.45.22.267 	the guy gives chili a look, puts his arm around his date, and quickly starts up the aisle so that chili can now see karen sitting there at the end of the row.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.50.48.629-00.50.48.962 	chili follows her gaze and we see.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.56.01.780-00.56.04.280 	harry looks up to see bo catlett, dressed up as usual, standing there with the bear, wearing a hawaiian shirt.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.59.26.822-00.59.29.822 	chili checks out the bar, sees they aren't there, then looks up at the railing.
0012_Get_Shorty_00.59.36.822-00.59.44.322 	chili moves to the staircase, now sees the bear in his hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.10.15.054-01.10.23.679 	as ray bones then walks off, we see coming out a different gate.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.15.12.495-01.15.15.893 	we can now see that one of the latinos is older, the other two, younger, are his bodyguards.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.18.03.175-01.18.09.580 	harry, a crumpled heap, looks up and we see his bloody pummeled face as ray bones quickly crosses the room.
0012_Get_Shorty_01.18.21.381-01.18.22.238 	harry actually looks glad to see him.

0026_The_Big_Fish_00.07.38.597-00.07.39.920 	as it keeps ringing, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.09.03.886-00.09.06.567 	edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in earshot.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.12.04.727-00.12.07.303 	we rush in on zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.14.42.408-00.14.48.922 	as he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.15.11.507-00.15.12.846 	although he's not the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.20.19.905-00.20.21.424 	although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first real exposure to grown-up edward, who we'll follow from roughly the ages of 18 to 30.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.21.49.986-00.21.51.366 	we still haven't seen the full stranger.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.22.18.471-00.22.20.150 	amid the crowd we see don price.

0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.04.932-00.24.05.710 	karl the giant is bigger than any man you've ever seen.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.39.541-00.24.42.273 	after a beat, edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.24.42.273-00.24.44.400 	relieved to see he's not licking his chops.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.26.19.404-00.26.26.917 	spirits buoyed by the high school marching band, all the good citizens of ashton are gathered to see off edward and karl.

0026_The_Big_Fish_00.28.47.933-00.28.49.925 	coming around a bend, his pitch drops as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.24.989-00.30.30.363 	dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.30.43.254-00.30.54.328 	in fact, there's a group of about 20 citizens spilling out to see edward approach.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.40.52.724-00.40.53.895 	edward turns to see to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.45.31.158-00.45.32.674 	around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.48.21.735-00.48.23.232 	from a very low angle, we look up to see just how massive he is.
0026_The_Big_Fish_00.55.01.040-00.55.02.415 	his head is tilted to the side, and as we pull back, we see why: he's holding it in a massive lion's open mouth.

0030_The_Hustler_02.03.36.103-02.03.51.698 	when bert sees eddie push open the glass doors, he draws himself up fearfully like a turtle, and motions with his eyes to his men for protection.

2012_Unbreakable_00.41.10.559-00.41.14.303 	he looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the green army jacket pass behind his car.

2026_Legion_00.02.28.456-00.02.32.779 	as his coat falls to the ground, we drift over to the brick wall behind him where we see michael's shadow crouch over, and then.

2026_Legion_00.36.13.201-00.36.15.137 	it's too dark to see who's behind the wheel.
2026_Legion_00.37.34.621-00.37.39.995 	as he steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even more clearly.

2026_Legion_01.07.50.308-01.07.55.979 	the man can only see silhouettes in this light, but he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.

2027_Les_Miserables_01.35.30.108-01.35.34.238 	we pull back from enjolras and marius holding their flag at the first floor window with the students beyond them to see that citizens have spilled out of the cafe musain into the street and have all joined in the final chorus.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.35.52.083-01.35.55.056 	among them we see enjolras, marius, and the radical students.
2027_Les_Miserables_01.57.15.462-01.57.19.971 	crane up and up - seeing the little world of the barricaded street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many that we know the little band can never win.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.02.49.004-02.02.50.597 	seeing him the soldiers hesitate.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.18.57.198-02.18.58.208 	they look round as the dance continues, highly satisfied with themselves and see marius.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.13.375-02.28.20.385 	as they disappear we crane up, high over the cloister, high over the walls of the convent and we see the paris streets outside.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.23.428-02.28.29.282 	and there marching among them we see ghosts from the past - enjolras and the students who died - and fantine - and eponine - and out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the grinning face of gavroche.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.36.255-02.28.38.370 	as the camera rises we see we're in the place de la bastille.
2027_Les_Miserables_02.28.42.390-02.28.44.304 	now among the marchers we see the ghost of valjean, singing with the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red flags.

2034_Super_8_00.03.21.107-00.03.39.243 	then the house back door bursts open -- joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, jack, leading an in-pain and hand-cuffed louis dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car.
2034_Super_8_00.03.39.285-00.03.41.826 	when he slams the back door, he sees joe.
2034_Super_8_00.08.58.280-00.09.02.317 	joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up from under the table -- and jack sees that joe is holding his mother's locket.

2034_Super_8_00.16.52.103-00.16.59.998 	joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle turns onto the tracks.
2034_Super_8_00.18.52.299-00.19.03.335 	we see joe tightly gripping his necklace locket in his hand -- then: crash!
2034_Super_8_00.19.04.330-00.19.07.711 	joe turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the noise -- but it is gone.
2034_Super_8_00.21.56.710-00.21.59.673 	push in on them as they arrive at the truck and stop; what they see makes joe's heart pound -- they're stunned -- all of them.
2034_Super_8_00.22.02.973-00.22.08.430 	we see now: it's dr. woodward -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage.
2034_Super_8_00.23.05.365-00.23.06.541 	we see marker writing on it -- a black line, from nevada to dayton -- and numbers written along the way.
2034_Super_8_00.30.22.988-00.30.27.742 	he sees joe and darkens as he approaches.
2034_Super_8_00.31.58.231-00.32.11.076 	joe moves the camera back to alice -- he looks through the lens -- uses the zoom -- and we see joe's pov -- the crash, zoomed in -- he pans from one car to another.
2034_Super_8_00.44.21.132-00.44.22.155 	doesn't understand what he sees -- push in on him.
2034_Super_8_00.47.16.025-00.47.23.298 	he heads for his office, seeing louis, who is being escorted out by an officer across the room.
2034_Super_8_00.50.28.584-00.50.33.292 	as it continues, we see alice behind the camera, watching joe, smiling.
2034_Super_8_00.50.36.653-00.50.41.369 	but then she sees something that disturbs her: jack's cruiser pulls up.
2034_Super_8_00.50.49.117-00.50.52.949 	but nelec has seen something outside: the kids.
2034_Super_8_00.54.58.072-00.55.02.486 	suddenly the three large military trucks' headlights come on -- all aimed at jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see.
2034_Super_8_00.55.13.279-00.55.14.405 	he's looking at someone we don't yet see.
2034_Super_8_00.55.19.642-00.55.21.016 	now we see who he's talking to.
2034_Super_8_00.59.52.505-00.59.54.674 	a tear drops down alice's face, though joe can't see that.
2034_Super_8_01.03.52.489-01.03.57.897 	louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car slams.
2034_Super_8_01.04.19.605-01.04.22.081 	alive is still looking back at the car -- so she doesn't see the shape that is coming behind her -- and just as she decides: i'm not going back, she turns to begin riding on.
2034_Super_8_01.07.41.985-01.07.47.795 	but joe has seen something -- on the screen -- sotto.
2034_Super_8_01.07.47.795-01.07.51.373 	but joe has slapped charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen -- charles looks too -- and now we see it: through the.
2034_Super_8_01.07.51.373-01.08.01.522 	too damn big -- mostly out of frame, its shape and flesh too bizarre -- we only see the legs as it clears frame.
2034_Super_8_01.09.59.943-01.10.05.205 	find joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally sees louis and hurries to him.
2034_Super_8_01.11.21.205-01.11.23.069 	now we see donny, looking right at us.
2034_Super_8_01.13.08.123-01.13.19.699 	jack drives up in the jeep -- comes to a stop in shocked close up -- we see in the distance the mass of vehicles driving from town -- jack's mind races.
2034_Super_8_01.15.45.025-01.15.47.276 	we see inside a hangar, where dozens of scientists examine large, bus-sized pieces of jagged and unearthly material.
2034_Super_8_01.22.49.585-01.22.53.401 	and there is joe and nelec, face-to-face -- joe seeing the fear in nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his fate.
2034_Super_8_01.23.25.583-01.23.38.002 	glass chunks rain down on the boys -- all covering their face -- cary seeing the creature.
2034_Super_8_01.24.54.053-01.24.56.742 	widen to see that he's taken the necklace from overmyer's dead body.
2034_Super_8_01.25.15.361-01.25.18.579 	he gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them.
2034_Super_8_01.27.58.109-01.28.00.674 	charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a hole in it; military vehicles can be seen driving past outside.
2034_Super_8_01.31.29.017-01.31.33.602 	joe and cary slowly move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them all at once.
2034_Super_8_01.31.53.301-01.31.55.577 	then joe sees something that makes him grab at cary's shirt.
2034_Super_8_01.32.22.578-01.32.25.968 	joe moves away from cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an inset section of the rock-wall, three human bodies, hanging.
2034_Super_8_01.32.26.071-01.32.26.995 	tight on joe as he sees, among them, alice.

2034_Super_8_01.33.09.651-01.33.13.410 	he sees the creature -- then looks across to the lifeless body of alice.
2034_Super_8_01.41.34.350-01.41.36.300 	and we see what's inside.
2034_Super_8_01.42.32.490-01.42.40.555 	street as the majestic ship completes its formation -- and that's when joe sees the creature, leaving -- climbing up the.
2034_Super_8_01.42.47.708-01.42.54.132 	and we push in as donny sleeps, the reflection of the rising ship seen in his windshield.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.12.29.666-00.12.31.335 	she hears a noise coming from her bedroom and looks to see d'artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.23.49.862-00.23.56.785 	but a moment later, she's looking back in the window, to see -- colin step out of the shower.
2040_The_Ugly_Truth_00.24.06.323-00.24.12.773 	abby leans closer to see colin start flossing, wearing only a towel.
