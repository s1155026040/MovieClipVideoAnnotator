0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.17.07.198-00.17.08.280 	fezzik, who goes to inigo.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.19.12.593-00.19.15.478 	inigo, watching as the man in black crawls to safety, then looks to inigo.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.22.59.608-00.23.02.332 	inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the man in black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing inigo back, closer and closer to death.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_00.23.42.387-00.23.44.397 	then the man in black copies inigo.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.02.29.867-01.02.33.502 	without a word fezzik stuffs inigo's head into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time, pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.08.10.672-01.08.11.873 	then inigo stops.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.10.12.063-01.10.16.606 	inigo pounds again.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.15.59.272-01.16.02.982 	fezzik helps inigo raise westley just high enough so he can see for himself.
0032_The_Princess_Bride_01.27.09.372-01.27.13.707 	then inigo withdraws his sword and as the count pitches down.
