0011_Gandhi_00.14.12.215-00.14.22.619 	behind him, gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes the box from singh and moves to the fire.
0011_Gandhi_00.15.23.434-00.15.25.678 	an instant of hesitation, then gandhi drops the card into the basket.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.25.861-00.16.27.736 	they step forward, one by one, making the pranam (the hindu gesture of greeting), then bending and touching the hands and lips to gandhi's feet in the traditional obeisance of child to father.
0011_Gandhi_00.16.32.168-00.16.35.967 	and ramdas runs to him and gandhi bends to kiss him as ramdas put his arms around his neck.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.41.684-00.21.44.414 	he waves, and gandhi shouts out to them all over the putt-putt of the generator.
0011_Gandhi_00.21.58.783-00.22.03.615 	walker measures gandhi with a little surprise.
0011_Gandhi_00.26.55.567-00.26.58.627 	khan leans towards singh, nodding to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.32.34.680-00.32.40.489 	as it pulls away, tyeb mohammed and singh come up to gandhi, both made wary by the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired.
0011_Gandhi_00.37.24.869-00.37.25.371 	the prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who gandhi is.
0011_Gandhi_00.40.53.340-00.40.55.849 	he hands it to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_00.44.14.538-00.44.15.687 	patel waves too but he eyes gandhi rather critically.
0011_Gandhi_00.45.50.120-00.45.52.350 	prakash grins and makes the pranam to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_01.04.33.665-01.04.38.285 	and suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on the concrete platform, and the english captain shoves his way through to confront gandhi down the little aisle that was being made for him.
0011_Gandhi_01.09.37.914-01.09.39.168 	and gandhi laughs.
0011_Gandhi_01.17.46.287-01.17.46.823 	the handsome europeanized nehru now wears an indian tunic -- much like the one that gandhi once wore.
0011_Gandhi_01.18.32.324-01.18.32.672 	holding his tea, he turns to gandhi with a little smile.
0011_Gandhi_01.39.38.040-01.39.40.348 	now gandhi raises a third finger.
0011_Gandhi_01.55.03.520-01.55.11.629 	he looks at gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to gandhi's side.
0011_Gandhi_01.56.36.142-01.56.37.654 	for a minute their eyes meet, the judge makes a little bow to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_01.57.20.488-01.57.24.797 	he turns, glancing at the empty table for defense counsel, and then to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.00.06.281-02.00.12.079 	another angle featuring walker and collins, who are sitting alone, in the cool shadows of the temple, watching with fascination as gandhi and ba repeat their marriage ceremony for them, walker jotting notes occasionally, but his eyes always glued to gandhi and ba, who are in part lost in memories and echoes of a significance only they can know.
0011_Gandhi_02.01.33.345-02.01.35.628 	and gandhi slowly lifts his hand.
0011_Gandhi_02.07.55.371-02.07.58.410 	he hurries along closer to gandhi again, one eye still on the police.
0011_Gandhi_02.27.16.331-02.27.18.800 	she has gandhi in the foreground, a soldier on the wall above and behind him.
0011_Gandhi_02.33.26.162-02.33.29.369 	he pauses, nods amiably to gandhi, though gandhi does not react to his presence at all.
0011_Gandhi_02.34.01.006-02.34.02.177 	the doctor turns his head slowly to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_02.46.49.930-02.46.52.480 	a police commissioner moves to gandhi's side, demanding his attention.
0011_Gandhi_02.55.05.771-02.55.06.315 	but gandhi holds up a shaking hand, stopping them.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.30.328-02.56.46.586 	but he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of hindu son to hindu father.
0011_Gandhi_02.56.46.586-02.56.48.339 	a second, and gandhi reaches out and touches the top of his head.
0011_Gandhi_02.59.24.673-02.59.25.280 	nehru bends to gandhi.
0011_Gandhi_03.00.02.583-03.00.04.418 	but bourke-white has looked from patel to gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in patel's words.
0011_Gandhi_03.01.00.182-03.01.07.384 	patel nods soberly and gandhi starts for the door, bourke- white moving with him.
